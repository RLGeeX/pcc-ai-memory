   - Integration testing: Descope test users with real API
   - NFS mount distribution strategy (no PyPI)
   - SSO scope: Manual setup for `pcconnect-main` (Google Workspace), out of v1.0
   - Testing approach: Local with pre-commit hooks (no CI/CD)
   - **Original files archived** in `.claude/plans/archive/` for reference

2. **Business Requirements Analysis** (`.claude/docs/business-requirements-analysis.md`)
   - Created by business-analyst agent
   - 4 detailed use cases with success criteria
   - 6 business rule categories and 6 edge cases
   - Success metrics and ROI justification

3. **Python Technical Analysis** (`.claude/docs/python-technical-analysis.md`)
   - Created by python-pro agent
   - Design patterns and code structure recommendations
   - Type safety strategy with Pydantic/mypy
   - Performance considerations and dependency guidance

### Agent Review Process
1. **Initial Reviews**: Both agents provided "Approve with Conditions"
   - Business-analyst: 3 critical conditions, 3 recommended changes
   - Python-pro: 2 blocking issues, 3 critical issues

2. **Design Revisions**: Addressed all issues systematically
   - Used brainstorming with MCP tools (Tavily search, Context7 docs)
   - Researched rate limiting algorithms and Descope API
   - Interactive questions to clarify SSO workflow and testing approach

3. **Final Approval (First Round)**: Both agents approved without conditions
   - Business-analyst: APPROVED (95% confidence)
   - Python-pro: APPROVED (Grade A, 95% confidence)

4. **Second Review (16:31 EST)**: Confirmed final approval after distribution strategy update
   - Business-analyst: APPROVED (95% confidence, Score: 96/100 - Excellent)
   - Python-pro: APPROVED WITHOUT CONDITIONS (Grade A-, 92%, 95% confidence)

### Critical Decisions Made

**SSO Configuration Approach**:
- Manual one-time setup in Descope Console for `pcconnect-main` tenant
- Google Workspace SSO for `pcconnect.ai` domain
- Tool manages additional portfolio company tenants programmatically
- v2.0 feature: SSO template replication

**Testing Strategy**:
- Local testing with pre-commit hooks (pytest, ruff, mypy)
- Manual integration tests with Descope test users (real API)
- Performance tests with benchmarks
- No CI/CD pipelines (all local)

**Rate Limiting Solution**:
- PyrateLimiter library (battle-tested, thread-safe)
- InMemoryBucket for local rate limiting
- Critical fix: Rate limiting at submission time (not in thread workers)
- Handles Descope limits (200 req/60s for tenants)

**Timeline and Scope**:
- Extended from 8 to 10 weeks with full scope
- Phase 5 added for documentation and internal deployment
- All features included: tenants + flows + performance + docs
- 95% confidence for successful delivery

**Distribution Strategy**:
- NFS mount only for 2-person team
- No PyPI packaging or git distribution
- Editable install from `/home/jfogarty/pcc/core/pcc-descope-mgmt`
- Simplified Phase 5 deliverables

### Issues Resolved

## 2025-11-13 Afternoon: Week 1 Foundation Complete

### Implementation Executed ✅

**ALL 12 CHUNKS EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY** in 4.5 hours (36% faster than 6-8 hour estimate)

**Final Statistics**:
- **Tests**: 65 passing (exceeded target of 61 by 6.6%)
- **Coverage**: 95% (exceeded target of 85% by 11.8%)
- **Commits**: 20 conventional commits (feat:, test:, style:)
- **Quality**: All checks passing (mypy strict, ruff, import-linter, pre-commit)
- **Git Tag**: `week1-complete` at commit 7a4f88a

### Complete Modules Implemented

**1. Type System (`src/descope_mgmt/types/`)** - 31 tests:
- `shared.py`: ResourceIdentifier base model (frozen, immutable)
- `protocols.py`: DescopeClientProtocol, RateLimiterProtocol (@runtime_checkable)
- `tenant.py`: TenantConfig with domain validation (regex patterns)
- `flow.py`: FlowConfig with Literal flow types
- `project.py`: ProjectSettings with environment enum (5 envs)
- `config.py`: DescopeConfig composite model with uniqueness validation
- `exceptions.py`: Custom exception hierarchy (DescopeMgmtError base + 4 specialized)

**2. Domain Layer (`src/descope_mgmt/domain/`)** - 9 tests:
- `env_sub.py`: Environment variable substitution (${VAR_NAME} pattern)
- `config_loader.py`: YAML config loader with Pydantic validation

**3. API Layer (`src/descope_mgmt/api/`)** - 18 unit + 1 integration:
- `rate_limiter.py`: PyrateLimiter wrapper with InMemoryBucket (200 req/60s)
- `executor.py`: RateLimitedExecutor with CRITICAL submission-time limiting
- `descope_client.py`: HTTP client with exponential backoff retry (2^n seconds)

**4. CLI Layer (`src/descope_mgmt/cli/`)** - 6 tests:
- `main.py`: Click-based CLI with command groups (tenant, flow)
- `context.py`: CliContext for command state management

**5. Test Infrastructure**:
- `tests/fakes.py`: FakeRateLimiter and FakeDescopeClient for testing
- `tests/fixtures/test_config.yaml`: Sample configuration
- `tests/integration/test_rate_limiting.py`: Real blocking behavior validation

### Critical Design Patterns Implemented

**Submission-Time Rate Limiting** (`src/descope_mgmt/api/executor.py:45`):
```python
def execute(self, task: Callable[[], T]) -> T:
    # CRITICAL: Acquire BEFORE execution prevents queue buildup
    self._rate_limiter.acquire()
    return task()
```

**Exponential Backoff Retry** (`src/descope_mgmt/api/descope_client.py:298-301`):
- Pattern: 2^attempt seconds (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Handles 429 rate limits and network errors
- Lives in HTTP layer (not domain)

**Hybrid Type Import Strategy**:
- ID references for cross-model relationships (prevents circular imports)
- Example: `TenantConfig.flow_ids: list[str]` (not nested FlowConfig objects)

**Protocol-Based Dependency Injection**:
- External boundaries only: DescopeClientProtocol, RateLimiterProtocol
- Internal services use concrete classes (reduces boilerplate for 2-person team)

### Execution Timeline

| Chunk | Name | Duration | Tests Added | Commits | Issues |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Project Setup | 15 min | 0 | 2 | None |
| 2 | Pre-commit Hooks | 37 min | 0 | 2 | Pre-commit pragmatic fixes |
| 3 | Type System Base | 18 min | 7 | 3 | None |
| 4 | TenantConfig | 20 min | 7 | 2 | Mutable default fixed |
| 5 | FlowConfig + ProjectSettings | 15 min | 6 | 1 | None |
| 6 | DescopeConfig (CHECKPOINT 1) | 20 min | 5 | 1 | None |
| 7 | Config Loader | 25 min | 9 | 2 | mypy override for tests |
| 8 | Custom Exceptions | 8 min | 6 | 2 | None |
| 9 | Rate Limiter | 20 min | 6 | 2 | Switch to local mypy |
| 10 | Rate Executor | 30 min | 7 | 2 | PyrateLimiter delay config |
| 11 | Descope Client | 35 min | 6 | 2 | Protocol type mismatch |
| 12 | CLI Entry (CHECKPOINT 2) | 20 min | 6 | 3 | None |

**Total**: 4.5 hours (270 minutes vs 420 estimated = 36% faster)

### Issues Resolved During Execution

1. **Mutable Default Argument** (Chunk 4):
   - Issue: `flow_ids: list[str] = []` violates Python best practices
   - Fix: Changed to `Field(default_factory=list)`
   - Detected by: Code reviewer subagent

2. **PyrateLimiter Raising Exceptions** (Chunk 10):
   - Issue: Default `raise_when_fail=True` causing exceptions instead of delays
   - Fix: Set `raise_when_fail=False` with `max_delay` configuration
   - Detected by: Integration test failure

3. **Protocol Type Mismatch** (Chunk 11):
   - Issue: Protocol used `dict` but implementation used `TenantConfig`
   - Fix: Updated protocol with TYPE_CHECKING guard
   - Detected by: mypy type checking

4. **Pre-commit Hook Failures** (Chunk 2):
   - Issue: import-linter and pytest failing before code exists
   - Fix: Pragmatic modifications to skip gracefully
   - Approved by: Code reviewer (pragmatic approach)

### Test Coverage Breakdown

**Coverage: 95%** (256 statements, 14 missed)

```
types/config.py         93%  (2 missed - error paths)
types/exceptions.py    100%
types/flow.py          100%
types/project.py       100%
types/protocols.py     100%
types/shared.py        100%
types/tenant.py        100%

domain/config_loader.py 91%  (2 missed - error handling)
domain/env_sub.py       95%  (1 missed - unreachable)

api/descope_client.py   86%  (7 missed - edge cases)
api/executor.py         82%  (4 missed - error handling)
api/rate_limiter.py    100%

cli/context.py          85%
cli/main.py            100%
```

**Missing Lines**: Primarily error handling edge cases (network timeouts, rare exceptions) difficult to trigger in unit tests.

## 2025-11-14 Morning: Week 2 Complete - All CLI Commands Implemented

### Week 2: 100% Complete (8 of 8 chunks) ✅

**Execution Summary:**
- **Total time:** ~6 hours (sequential would be ~6.5 hours)
- **Time saved:** ~80 minutes via parallel track execution
- **Tests:** 109 passing (up from 65 baseline, +44 new tests)
- **Coverage:** 91% across all modules
- **Commits:** 19 conventional commits
- **Git tag:** `week2-complete` created at commit `9662435`

### All Chunks Completed

**Chunks 1-3 (Sequential Foundation - 80 min):**
1. ✅ Global CLI options + Rich console setup
2. ✅ Tenant list command with table formatting
3. ✅ TenantManager service layer

**Chunks 4, 7-8 (Parallel Execution - 45 min, saved ~80 min):**
- Track A: ✅ Chunk 4 - Tenant create command
- Track B: ✅ Chunk 7 - Flow list, Chunk 8 - Flow deploy

**Chunks 5-6 (Final CRUD - 50 min):**
1. ✅ Tenant update command with diff display
2. ✅ Tenant delete command with confirmation

### Commands Now Available

All tenant CRUD operations and flow management commands are functional:

```bash
# Tenant management (complete CRUD)
descope-mgmt tenant list
descope-mgmt tenant create --id <id> --name <name>
descope-mgmt tenant update --id <id> [options]
descope-mgmt tenant delete --id <id> [--force]

# Flow operations
descope-mgmt flow list
descope-mgmt flow deploy --flow-id <id> --screen-id <id>

# Global options
--verbose, --dry-run, --config PATH
```

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Code duplication**: Client initialization in 6 command locations - Priority: High (Week 3)
2. **Local imports**: TenantConfig imported in functions - Priority: Low
3. **Flow type validation**: Dual sources of truth - Priority: Medium (Week 3)
4. **Missing tenant filter**: Flow list not tenant-specific - Priority: Defer to Week 4+

### Quality Metrics

**Tests:** 109 passing
- Chunk 1: 5 tests
- Chunk 2: 4 tests
- Chunk 3: 8 tests
- Chunk 4: 6 tests (tenant create)
- Chunk 5: 6 tests (tenant update + diff)
- Chunk 6: 5 tests (tenant delete)
- Chunks 7-8: 10 tests (flow manager + commands)

**Coverage:** 91%
- cli/tenant_cmds.py: 89%
- cli/flow_cmds.py: 90%
- cli/diff.py: 100%
- domain/tenant_manager.py: 95%
- domain/flow_manager.py: 95%

**Quality Checks:** All passing
- mypy: 25 source files, strict mode ✅
- ruff: No violations ✅
- lint-imports: All contracts kept ✅
- pre-commit: All hooks passing ✅

### Parallel Execution Success

**Strategy:**
- Chunks 1-3: Sequential (foundation)

- Chunks 5-6: Sequential (complete tenant CRUD)

**Results:**
- No merge conflicts
- All tests passing
- Time saved: ~80 minutes
- Quality maintained: 91% coverage
