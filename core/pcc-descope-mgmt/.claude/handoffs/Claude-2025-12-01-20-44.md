# Session Handoff: Milestone 6 Complete - Advanced Operations & Audit

## Project Context
- pcc-descope-mgmt: Python CLI for Descope infrastructure management
- Milestone 6 (PCC-171) execution completed - all 12 chunks implemented and committed

## Completed Tasks
- **Phase 1 (Chunks 1-3)**: BatchExecutor with concurrent execution, adaptive workers, progress callbacks
- **Phase 2 (Chunks 4-7)**: Tenant/Flow delete commands with backup support, --force/--no-backup flags
- **Phase 3 (Chunks 8-10)**: Audit log filtering, JSON/CSV export, statistics dashboard
- **Phase 4 (Chunks 11-12)**: Performance benchmarks, AdaptiveRateLimiter with dynamic rate adjustment
- 8 commits total, 285 tests passing (92% coverage)

## Pending Tasks
- **CRITICAL**: Jira tickets NOT updated during execution - need manual transition:
  - PCC-252 (Batch Executor): In Progress -> Done
  - PCC-253 (Tenant Delete): To Do -> Done
  - PCC-254 (Flow Delete): To Do -> Done
  - PCC-255 (Audit Enhancements): To Do -> Done
  - PCC-256 (Rate Limit): To Do -> Done
  - PCC-171 (Epic): To Do -> Done
- 1 pre-existing test failure: `test_create_client_missing_credentials_raises_error`

## Next Steps
1. Transition all Jira tickets to Done (user handling manually)
2. Push commits to remote: `git push origin main`
3. Consider fixing pre-existing test failure in client_factory.py
4. Update plan-meta.json with execution history (optional)
