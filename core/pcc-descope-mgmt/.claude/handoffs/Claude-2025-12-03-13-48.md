# Session Handoff: pcc-demo-descope Plan Creation & Partial Execution

## Project Context
- Created implementation plan for pcc-demo-descope React site to test Descope authentication
- Set up Descope tenant (pcc-test), user (johnafogarty4+pcctest@gmail.com), and role (test-user) via CLI
- Plan execution paused after chunk 1 due to development approach concerns

## Completed Tasks
- **Descope Setup via CLI:**
  - Created tenant: `pcc-test` with domain `pcctest.local`
  - Invited user: `johnafogarty4+pcctest@gmail.com` (User ID: U36LVOVvGbPBbl65B43JeimVzXI0)
  - Created role: `test-user` and assigned to user
- **Plan Creation:** 10 chunks across 4 phases (Project Setup, Core Implementation, Polish & Config, Containerization)
- **Jira Hierarchy Created:**
  - Epic: PCC-328
  - Stories: PCC-329 to PCC-332
  - Sub-tasks: PCC-333 to PCC-342
  - All with labels: `descope-management`, `cc-opus-4.5`, assigned to John Fogarty
- **Chunk 1 Executed:** Vite React TypeScript project scaffolded at `/home/jfogarty/pcc/src/pcc-demo-descope`
  - React 19.2.0, TypeScript 5.9.3, Vite 7.2.4
  - PCC-333 transitioned to Done

## Pending Tasks
- Chunks 2-10 not executed (plan paused)
- User raised concern: plan structure assumes local dev first, then Docker - needs clarification on desired approach

## Next Steps
1. Decide development approach: local-first vs Docker-first vs container-only
2. Resume plan execution: `/cc-unleashed:plan-resume` or `/cc-unleashed:plan-next`
3. If restructuring needed, update plan chunks to match desired approach
