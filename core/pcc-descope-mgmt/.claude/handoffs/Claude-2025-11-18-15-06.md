# Session Handoff: Week 4 Complete - GitHub Push & Week 5 Planning

## Project Context
- **Project**: pcc-descope-mgmt - Python CLI for Descope infrastructure management
- **Phase**: Week 4 of 10 complete (40% overall progress)
- **Session Focus**: Completed Week 4 chunk 6, fixed GitHub remote config, pushed all work, preparing Week 5 plan

## Completed Tasks

### Week 4 Final Chunk (Chunk 6: Enhanced Validation)
- ✅ Created `SyncValidator` with pre-flight validation for sync operations
  - Validates unique tenant IDs across configuration
  - Detects duplicate domains across tenants
  - Ensures required fields (id, name) are not empty
  - Validates backup metadata for restore operations
- ✅ Integrated validation into `tenant sync` command with helpful error messages
- ✅ Added 7 comprehensive tests (5 validator + 2 CLI integration)
- ✅ All 193 tests passing (189 passed, 4 skipped), 94% coverage maintained
- ✅ Commit: 58a8caf - Clean conventional commit (no co-authored-by)

### Git Remote & Tagging Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed git remote configuration (was HTTPS, changed to SSH: `github-pcc:PORTCoCONNECT/pcc-descope-mgmt.git`)
- ✅ Pushed all 49 commits from Weeks 1-4 to GitHub (main branch created on remote)
- ✅ Created and pushed `week4-complete` tag
- ✅ Pushed all existing tags: `week1-complete`, `week2-complete`, `week4-complete`
- ⚠️ **Note**: `week3-complete` tag still needs to be created (Week 3 was complete but no tag exists)

### Week 4 Summary
- **All 6 chunks complete**: Error formatting, progress tracking, audit logging, validation
- **Tests**: 151 → 193 (+42 new tests)
- **Coverage**: 94% maintained throughout
- **Commits**: 10 clean conventional commits (25a68c2 → 58a8caf)
- **Execution**: 2 hours total, all automated with code reviews
- **Quality**: All checks passing (mypy strict, ruff, lint-imports)

## Pending Tasks

### Immediate: Week 5 Planning
- ⏳ **In progress**: Creating Week 5 implementation plan using write-plan skill
- **Interrupted**: User requested handoff documentation before completing plan
- **Decision needed**: Week 5 scope (Flow Import/Export vs Flow Templates vs Performance Optimization)
- **Context**: Flow commands (list, deploy) already exist from earlier weeks

### Recommendations for Week 5
Based on design doc (`@.claude/plans/design.md` lines 1233-1247):
1. **Option 1 - Flow Import/Export** (originally Week 6):
   - `flow export` command for backing up flow configurations
   - Flow versioning and warnings system
   - Flow rollback capability
   - End-to-end testing for flow lifecycle

2. **Option 2 - Flow Templates** (originally Week 5):
   - Pre-built flow templates (sign-up-or-in, mfa-login, magic-link, social-login)
   - Template deployment system
   - Template customization framework
   - Note: Basic flow deploy already exists, need template library

3. **Option 3 - Performance Optimization** (originally Week 7):
   - Batch operation optimization with adaptive worker pools
   - Memory profiling for large configurations
   - Connection pooling tuning
   - Performance benchmarks and tests

## Next Steps
1. **Resume Week 5 planning**: User should respond with desired Week 5 scope (Options 1-3 above)
2. **Execute write-plan skill**: Create micro-chunked plan for selected Week 5 scope
3. **Create week3-complete tag**: `git tag -a week3-complete <commit> -m "Week 3: Configuration & Real API complete"`
4. **Begin Week 5 execution**: Use `/cc-unleashed:plan-next` to start automated execution
