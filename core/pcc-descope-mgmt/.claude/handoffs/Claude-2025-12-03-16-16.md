# Session Handoff: Docker-First Plan Created for pcc-demo-descope

## Project Context
- Created new Docker-first implementation plan for pcc-demo-descope React site
- Replaced local-first plan with container-only development approach
- All Jira cards updated to reflect new 9-chunk plan structure

## Completed Tasks
- Created Docker-first plan at `.claude/plans/pcc-demo-descope-docker/` (9 chunks)
- Deleted old local-first plan at `.claude/plans/pcc-demo-descope/`
- Updated Jira hierarchy:
  - Epic PCC-328: Updated description for Docker-first approach
  - Stories PCC-329-332: Renamed to Phase 1-4
  - Sub-tasks PCC-333-341: Renamed to Chunk 1-9
  - PCC-342: Marked DEPRECATED (needs manual deletion)
- Reset PCC-333, PCC-334, PCC-329 statuses back to "To Do"

## Pending Tasks
- **Manual Action Required**: Delete PCC-342 in Jira (deprecated, not needed)
- Plan execution not started (all 9 chunks pending)

## Next Steps
1. Delete PCC-342 manually: https://portcoconnect.atlassian.net/browse/PCC-342
2. Start plan execution: `/cc-unleashed:plan-execute` or `/cc-unleashed:plan-next`
3. Chunk 1 creates Docker dev environment (Dockerfile.dev, docker-compose.yml)
