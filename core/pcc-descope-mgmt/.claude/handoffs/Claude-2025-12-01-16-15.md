# Session Handoff: Milestone 6 Plan Execution (Partial)

## Project Context
- Working on pcc-descope-mgmt CLI tool for Descope infrastructure management
- Executing Milestone 6 (PCC-171) - Advanced Operations phase
- Plan created with 12 chunks across 4 phases

## Completed Tasks
- Created full implementation plan in `plans/milestone-6-advanced-ops/` (12 chunks)
- Updated all Jira tickets (PCC-171, PCC-252-256) with plan details
- Transitioned PCC-252 to "In Progress"
- **Chunk 1, Task 1**: BatchResult types - committed (c972be8)
- **Chunk 1, Task 2**: BatchExecutor class - implemented, tests pass (5/5), NOT committed

## Pending Tasks
- Chunk 1, Task 2: Needs commit and code review
- Chunk 1, Task 3: Quality checks (run full test suite, linting)
- Update plan-meta.json with executionHistory after chunk completion
- Chunks 2-12 remaining

## Issues Encountered
- Skill execution errors: Skipped Jira transition, skipped code review, not updating plan-meta.json
- User had to correct workflow multiple times
- Need to follow execute-plan-with-subagents skill more carefully

## Next Steps
1. Commit BatchExecutor (Task 2): `git add ... && git commit -m "feat(domain): add BatchExecutor with result tracking"`
2. Dispatch code-reviewer for Task 2
3. Run Task 3 quality checks
4. Update plan-meta.json with executionHistory for Chunk 1
5. Continue with Chunk 2 (Progress Tracking)
