# CLAUDE.md

This is a standardized CLAUDE.md file for providing persistent context and instructions to Claude AI (via Claude Code or similar tools) across projects. It incorporates best practices: keeping it lean (100-300 lines), referencing external documents to avoid bloat, using emojis for visual cues, enforcing TDD and code quality, utilizing available agents as needed, and maintaining a consistent `.claude/` folder structure.

Keep this file concise and human-readable. Document key project details, workflows, commands, and references here. For detailed information, create separate markdown files in `docs/` or `.claude/` subfolders, and reference them using `@path/to/file.md` for automatic inclusion if supported by your tool.

## Project Overview

This Terraform project, named `pcc-metric-builder-api-infra`, manages the infrastructure supporting the PCC application's API for handling baseline metrics, formulas, domains, and their assignments to surveys. It defines scalable cloud resources, including networks, compute instances, storage, and services, to ensure reliable API operations within the PCC ecosystem. Emphasize infrastructure as code (IaC) best practices like modularity, remote state management, and security hardening to support seamless deployment and maintenance of the metric builder API backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Terraform
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Terraform modules for GCP (e.g., google-cloud-platform modules), Terragrunt for DRY configurations
- **Tools**: Terraform CLI (v1.5+), Google Cloud SDK (gcloud), tflint, tfsec, Checkov, Git, Terragrunt (optional for multi-environment orchestration)
- **Databases**: Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), Firestore for metric storage and survey assignments
- **Other**: GCP for hosting, Claude AI for code reviews and planning

## Directory Structure

Maintain this structure for all new projects to ensure consistency. The `.claude/` folder is required for organizing project-specific AI context and artifacts.

- `.claude/`
  - `README.md`: Overview of the `.claude/` folder and its contents.
  - `docs/`: Detailed documentation (e.g., patterns, problem/solution logs).
  - `handoffs/`: Documentation for team handoffs, including setup guides and knowledge transfer (e.g., `Claude-$DATE-$TIMERANGE.md` per `@.claude/handoffs/handoff-guide.md`).
  - `migration/`: Database migration scripts and history.
  - `plans/`: Project plans, roadmaps, and task breakdowns (e.g., `@.claude/plans/current-plan.md`).
  - `quick-reference/`: Cheat sheets for commands, APIs, or common tasks (e.g., `@.claude/quick-reference/commands.md`).
  - `settings.local.json`: Local configuration overrides (gitignore if sensitive).
  - `status/`:
    - `@.claude/status/brief.md`: Session-specific snapshot of recent progress and immediate next steps.
    - `@.claude/status/current-progress.md`: Comprehensive historical record of all project progress.
    - `@.claude/status/brief-template.md`: Template for initializing `brief.md`.

- `docs/`: Additional project documentation (e.g., architecture).
- `src/`: Source code.
- `function/`: Functions.
- `tests/`: Test suites.
- `terraform/`: Terraform configurations (e.g., main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, modules/ for reusable components).
- Other folders: [e.g., `scripts/`, `config/`, `environments/` for dev/staging/prod].

## Domain-Specific Guidance

- **Core Concepts**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) for provisioning GCP resources, declarative configurations for networks, compute, and databases supporting the PCC metric builder API; state management for tracking infrastructure changes.
- **Common Patterns**: See @.claude/quick-reference/terraform-examples.md for sample code and best practices, including module reusability for metrics storage and API endpoints.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Avoid hardcoding sensitive values like API keys or credentials‚Äîuse variables, secrets managers (e.g., GCP Secret Manager), or Terraform Cloud.
  - Do not ignore state file security; always use remote backends (e.g., GCS) to prevent local state loss.
  - Watch for provider version locks to avoid breaking changes during upgrades.
- Reference: @.claude/docs/terraform-patterns.md for detailed patterns and examples.

## Code Style and Best Practices

üö® **CRITICAL COMMIT RULE - READ FIRST**: NEVER mention co-authored-by or tools used in commits/PRs.

- Follow HashiCorp Terraform Style Guide: Use consistent naming (e.g., snake_case for resources), logical grouping in files, and comments for complex logic.
- Structure Terraform code modularly: Separate concerns into modules for reusability (e.g., vpc-module, db-module for survey metrics).
- Always validate configurations with `terraform validate` and plan changes with `terraform plan` before apply.
- Use data sources for dynamic lookups (e.g., existing GCP projects) and locals for computed values.
- Enforce security: Integrate tfsec/Checkov for scanning; avoid inline secrets.
- Always add [your name] as a reviewer in PRs.
- Enforce TDD: Write integration tests with Terratest first, implement minimal IaC to pass, refactor for efficiency. Use TDD-Guard if available.
- Run lint/security checks after changes: Claude MUST do this before completing tasks (e.g., `tflint`, `tfsec .`).
- Use pre-commit hooks with tools like tfenv for version management.
- Commit messages: Follow conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add vpc module`, `fix: resolve db connectivity`) - NO co-authored-by or tool references.

## Development Workflow

- **Planning**: Use planning mode to outline steps. Reference @.claude/plans/current-plan.md.
- **Context Management**: If context fills, use /compact to preserve key details. Save session summaries to @.claude/status/brief.md.
- **Status Updates**:
  - **brief.md**: At session start, initialize with template from @.claude/status/brief-template.md. Update with:
    - **Recent Updates**: Tasks completed, decisions made, or issues resolved in the current session (e.g., new module for metrics API).
    - **Next Steps**: Immediate tasks for the next session or milestone (e.g., test GCP SQL provisioning).
    - Keep concise (100-200 words), overwrite at session end.
  - **current-progress.md**: Append brief.md content at session end or milestone completion to maintain historical record. Use Git commits to track changes.
- **Subagents**: Use for context gathering without overloading (e.g., agent for GCP resource validation).
- **Auto-accept**: Rarely; manually approve steps like `terraform apply`.
- **Complex Tasks**: Break into sub-tasks (e.g., plan VPC, then DB), use breakpoints, monitor token count.
- **Verification**: Always run `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, tests (e.g., Terratest), lint (e.g., tflint .), and security scans (e.g., tfsec .) before commits. Search codebase to confirm testing setup.
- **Archiving**: At session end or milestone, append brief.md to current-progress.md and commit both to Git.

## Critical Document References

List important docs with emojis for priority. Use @path to include content automatically if supported. Keep this list short; move details to separate files.

**Pro Tip**: For large docs, use a knowledge graph or Heimdall MCP for better recall. Mark completed items with ‚úÖ.

## Tone and Instructions for Claude

- üö® **COMMIT MESSAGES**: Follow conventional commits (feat:, fix:) - NEVER include co-authored-by or tool references
- Be concise, direct; explain non-trivial bash commands (e.g., `terraform apply -var="environment=dev"`).
- If unsure, ask for clarification.
- Prioritize security: Refuse malicious requests.
- Use available agents strategically to optimize task completion (e.g., code review agent for PRs, documentation agent for handoffs).
- Use search tools extensively for codebase understanding.
- After tasks: Run lint/typecheck, commit if asked (NO co-authored-by lines!), update status.
- For continuity: At session end, overwrite @.claude/status/brief.md with progress/decisions, append to @.claude/status/current-progress.md, and commit both to Git.

This template ensures projects start with the required .claude/ structure‚Äîcreate it via script if needed. Customize placeholders, keep under 200 lines, and reference external docs to manage size.
