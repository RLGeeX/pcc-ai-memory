# Session Brief Template

Use this template to initialize `@.claude/status/brief.md` at session start. Overwrite at session end with updates and next steps.

## Recent Updates
- [List tasks completed, decisions, or issues resolved this session]

## Next Steps
- [List immediate tasks or milestones for next session]

**Note**: Keep concise (100-200 words). Append to `@.claude/status/current-progress.md` at session end. **NEVER commit** these files.
