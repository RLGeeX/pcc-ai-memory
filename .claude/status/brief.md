# Current Session Brief

**Date**: 2025-10-18 16:07 EDT
**Session Type**: Three-Way AI Architectural Consultation
**Status**: ‚è≥ AWAITING USER DECISION - Ingress Strategy

## üö´ Implementation Timeline

**PLANNING ONLY UNTIL 10/20** - No implementation work before Monday, October 20th
- 10/17 (Fri), 10/18 (Sat), 10/19 (Sun): Planning, requirements, documentation only
- 10/20 (Mon): Implementation work can begin
- All terraform apply, resource deployment, and infrastructure changes deferred until 10/20+

## Session Focus: Ingress Strategy Decision - COMPLETE

### Three-Way AI Consultation Results

**‚úÖ UNANIMOUS: Private Service Connect (PSC) from Day 1**
All 3 AI perspectives (Claude, Gemini, Codex) agreed:
- Deploy PSC immediately for both devtest and production
- Skip VPC peering entirely (avoids future migration)
- Better security, scalability, no IP overlap issues

**üîÄ SPLIT: Ingress Layer**
- **Gemini + Claude**: NGINX + PSC from day 1 (AI assistance nullifies complexity barrier)
- **Codex**: GKE Ingress + PSC first (AI can't remove 24/7 operational accountability)

### User Decision: GKE Ingress + PSC ‚úÖ

**Rationale:**
- No concrete requirement TODAY for advanced NGINX features
- Operational simplicity (Google manages ingress layer)
- Awaiting backend dev feedback on routing requirements (path rewrites)
- Flexible: Can pivot to NGINX + PSC if requirements emerge

**Key Insight (Codex):**
"AI reduces build effort but doesn't change ownership model - running NGINX makes your team the data-plane owner with operational duties Google otherwise absorbs"

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **ADR-002 Updated**: GKE Ingress + PSC selected, includes PSC architecture rationale
2. ‚è≥ **Backend Dev Feedback**: Awaiting assessment of NGINX rewrite requirements
3. ‚è≥ **Generate Terraform**: Create modules for PSC + GKE Ingress (10/17-10/19)
4. ‚è≥ **Implement 10/20+**: Deploy PSC + GKE Ingress during implementation week
