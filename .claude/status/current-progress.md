## ⏸️ Session: 2025-10-15 20:19 EDT - Apigee Pipeline Planning (SUPERSEDED)

**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Type**: Architecture Planning
**Status**: ⏸️ SUPERSEDED - 8-phase plan created but Phase 1 needs complete rewrite due to greenfield assumption

### Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive 8-phase Apigee pipeline implementation plan using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Documented complete CI/CD architecture: GitHub → Cloud Build (9 steps) → Docker/ArgoCD/Apigee
- Covered all 7 microservices (auth, client, user, metric-builder, metric-tracker, task-builder, task-tracker)
- Plan includes Terraform configs, pipeline scripts, K8s manifests, POC strategy, and multi-env roadmap
- Saved to `.claude/plans/apigee-pipeline-implementation-plan.md`

### Key Decisions
- Centralized pipeline library (pcc-pipeline-library) with 5 reusable bash scripts
- ArgoCD GitOps deployment pattern
- OpenAPI spec generation with service-specific path filtering
- Service onboarding target: ≤15 minutes per service
- Initial deployment to devtest environment only

### Status
- Plan approved and documented
- Implementation has NOT started
- Awaiting user selection of starting phase

### Next Session
- User to decide: Phase 1 (Terraform), Phase 2 (Scripts), Phase 3 (ArgoCD), Phase 4 (POC), or Sequential
- Begin implementation based on plan
- Track multi-step tasks with TodoWrite

## ⏸️ Session: 2025-10-15 20:33 EDT - Detailed Phase Planning Setup (SUPERSEDED)

**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Type**: Planning Methodology
**Status**: ⏸️ SUPERSEDED - Planning approach established but Phase 1 needs rewrite to integrate with existing infrastructure

### Accomplishments
- Corrected plan location: moved to `.claude/plans/` (not `.claude/reference/`)
- Removed Swashbuckle assumptions (.NET 10 incompatibility)
- Updated `generate-spec.sh` to find pre-built OpenAPI specs (not generate)
- Established hybrid planning approach: local subagents + Zen MCP synthesis
- Created TodoWrite workflow for 8 phase-specific detailed plans

### Key Decisions
- Use agent-organizer to analyze each phase requirements
- Launch parallel specialist subagents (cloud-architect, deployment-engineer, etc.)
- Synthesize with Zen planner (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for comprehensive output
- Create 8 phase-specific markdown files in `.claude/plans/`
- Process phases sequentially (1-7), not all at once

### Status
- Master plan updated and corrected
- Ready to begin Phase 1 detailed planning with subagents
- Task interrupted by user before agent-organizer completed

### Next Session
- Resume Phase 1 analysis with agent-organizer
- Launch recommended specialist subagents in parallel
- Synthesize Phase 1 detailed plan with Zen MCP
- Create `.claude/plans/phase-1-foundation-infrastructure.md`

## ⏸️ Session: 2025-10-15 21:51 EDT - Phase 1a Terraform-First Correction (SUPERSEDED)

**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Type**: Planning Review & Course Correction
**Status**: ⏸️ SUPERSEDED - Terraform-first approach validated but greenfield assumption still incorrect

### Accomplishments
- Completed Phase 1a specialist analysis with 3 parallel subagents:
  - cloud-architect: GCP infrastructure architecture (25KB, Terraform examples) ✓
  - deployment-engineer: GCP pre-flight checklist (24KB, gcloud CLI commands) ✗
  - documentation-expert: CLAUDE.md audit (identified 0% Apigee coverage) ✓
- Attempted Zen MCP synthesis via clink tool (gemini/codex CLIs) - both failed
- **Critical discovery**: deployment-engineer used wrong approach (manual CLI instead of Terraform IaC)

### Key Decisions
- **Terraform-First Mandate**: All GCP infrastructure MUST use Terraform (infrastructure-as-code)
- Discard `phase-1a-gcp-preflight-checklist.md` (violates IaC principles)
- Keep `phase-1a-architecture-design.md` (has good Terraform examples)
- Re-run deployment-engineer with explicit Terraform-first instructions
- User clarified: CLAUDE.md is generic repo file, not Apigee-specific (documentation updates go elsewhere)

### Issue Identified
deployment-engineer created manual provisioning guide with:
- `gcloud services enable`, `gcloud artifacts repositories create`
- `kubectl create namespace`, `gsutil mb` (GCS bucket)
- `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` (IAM roles)

**Correct approach should be:**
1. Terraform modules in `core/pcc-tf-library/modules/` (apigee-iam, artifact-registry, secret-manager, gcs-bucket)
2. Terraform configs in `infra/pcc-app-shared-infra/terraform/`
3. gcloud/kubectl ONLY for post-deployment validation

### Zen MCP Tool Issues
- `mcp__zen__clink` with gemini CLI: "Error when talking to Gemini API" (empty stdout)
- `mcp__zen__clink` with codex CLI: "Not inside a trusted directory" error
- Workaround: Manual synthesis or fix Zen MCP configuration

### Status
- Phase 1a needs redo with Terraform-first approach
- Updated todos to reflect deployment-engineer redo
- All planning work is documentation-only (no infrastructure changes)

### Next Session
- Re-run deployment-engineer with Terraform-focused prompt
- Synthesize Phase 1 from architecture + new Terraform guide
- Create `.claude/plans/phase-1-foundation-infrastructure.md`
- Continue to Phase 2-7 planning


---

## ✅ Session: 2025-10-16 10:15 EDT - AI CLI Integration Strategy (COMPLETE)

**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Type**: Tooling Investigation & Documentation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Direct CLI integration strategy resolved and documented

### Accomplishments
- Investigated zen-mcp clink integration issues for gemini and codex CLIs
- Diagnosed root causes: Gemini OAuth vs API key conflict, Codex trust directory issue
- Validated both CLIs work perfectly when called directly via Bash
- Established direct CLI integration strategy for subagent consultation
- Created comprehensive documentation: `.claude/quick-reference/ai-cli-commands.md`
  - Gemini: OAuth setup, heredoc examples, architecture planning patterns
  - Codex: exec mode, trust flags, code review workflows
  - Integration patterns for subagents calling external CLIs via Bash
  - Best practices, troubleshooting, PCC-specific examples

### Key Decisions
**Direct CLI Integration (Bypass MCP):**
- Zen-mcp clink has known limitations with Gemini CLI (documented in zen-mcp-server)
- Direct Bash calls provide immediate functionality, transparency, no config debugging
- Subagents have Bash access and can autonomously consult gemini/codex
- Workflow: `Me → subagent → CLI (gemini/codex) → subagent → synthesis → Me`

### Status
- Tooling strategy resolved and documented
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1a deployment-engineer redo using direct CLI calls
- All planning work is documentation-only (no infrastructure changes)

### Next Session
- Launch deployment-engineer with Terraform-first mandate
- Have subagent call gemini/codex directly for Terraform provisioning guide
- Synthesize Phase 1 plan from architecture + new Terraform guide
- Continue Phase 2-7 planning with validated CLI integration approach

## ⚠️ Session: 2025-10-16 12:01 EDT - Phase 1 Completion & Codex Review (NEEDS REVISION)

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Type**: Architecture Planning & Documentation
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION - Comprehensive planning docs created but incorrectly reference non-existent projects

### Accomplishments
- Launched deployment-engineer with Terraform-first mandate using direct gemini CLI integration
- Completely rewrote Terraform provisioning guide (v2.0, 1,852 lines in `.claude/plans/`)
- Synthesized comprehensive Phase 1 plan (530 lines in `.claude/plans/`)
- Conducted Codex review of Phase 1 plan (9 critical findings)
- Created Apigee X Networking Specification (55KB in `.claude/docs/`) addressing VPC peering, service networking, Cloud NAT, IP ranges
- Created Apigee X Traffic Routing Specification (67KB in `.claude/docs/`) covering external HTTPS load balancers, Google-managed certificates, environment groups
- Updated Phase 1 plan with networking references and production requirements roadmap
- Moved all planning docs to `.claude/docs/` per project structure guidelines

### Key Decisions
- **4 Separate Apigee Organizations Architecture**: Complete project isolation (devtest→pcc-devtest, dev→pcc-dev, staging→pcc-staging, prod→pcc-prod)
- **100% Terraform Infrastructure**: Zero manual provisioning, all infrastructure as code
- **Phase 1 Planning Complete**: All specifications, modules, configs, and deployment procedures documented
- **Implementation Deferred**: User clarified we're in planning-only mode until ALL phases (1-8) have detailed plans

### Status
- Phase 1 planning 100% complete with all Codex findings addressed
- Ready to begin Phase 2-8 detailed planning
- No implementation work will begin until comprehensive planning for all phases is complete
- All documentation organized in `.claude/plans/` directory

### Next Session
- Begin Phase 2 detailed planning (Pipeline Library & Cloud Build)
- Continue through Phases 3-8 planning sequentially
- Use specialist subagents + AI CLI consultation for each phase
- Create phase-specific markdown documents for each phase

## 🔄 Session: 2025-10-17 12:40 EDT - Critical Infrastructure Gap Identification (ACTIVE)

**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Type**: Context Review & Gap Analysis
**Status**: 🔄 ACTIVE - Awaiting user clarification on project mappings and network integration

### Accomplishments
- Reviewed user concern about fundamental misunderstanding of project requirements
- Conducted thorough investigation of `pcc-foundation-infra` repository
- Discovered 15 GCP projects already deployed (220 resources, deployed 2025-10-03)
- Identified critical error: ADR 001 and Phase 1 plan assumed greenfield infrastructure
- Documents incorrectly referenced `pcc-dev` and `pcc-prod` projects that don't exist
- Created comprehensive handoff documenting gap and questions

### Critical Discovery
**Existing Infrastructure (pcc-foundation-infra):**
- 15 projects deployed: app (4), data (4), devops (2), network (2), systems (2), logging (1)
- 2 VPCs (prod/nonprod) with Shared VPC architecture
- Complete folder hierarchy, firewall rules, Cloud NAT, Cloud Routers
- 12 service projects attached to VPC hosts
- Production-ready infrastructure (9/10 security score)

**Planning Documents Created (INCORRECT):**
- ADR 001: References `pcc-dev` and `pcc-prod` (don't exist)
- Phase 1 Plan: Assumes greenfield, proposes new IP allocations
- Ignored existing VPC topology and project structure

### Key Questions Raised (AWAITING USER CLARIFICATION)
1. Which existing projects should host the 2 Apigee organizations?
   - Likely: `pcc-prj-app-dev` (nonprod) + `pcc-prj-app-prod` (prod)?
2. Network integration strategy with existing VPCs?
3. Should Apigee modules integrate into `pcc-foundation-infra` terraform?

### Status
- Planning BLOCKED awaiting user clarification
- Handoff created: `.claude/handoffs/Claude-2025-10-17-12-40.md`
- ADR 001 and Phase 1 plan need complete rewrite to integrate with existing infrastructure
- Cannot proceed with Phases 2-8 planning until architectural questions resolved

### Next Session
- Await user clarification on project mappings
- Rewrite ADR 001 to reflect integration with existing 15 projects
- Rewrite Phase 1 as Apigee integration plan (not greenfield)
- Address peer review findings after architectural alignment

## 🔄 Session: 2025-10-17 13:15 EDT - Apigee Project Architecture Decision (ACTIVE)

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Type**: Architectural Decision & AI Consultation

### Accomplishments
- Consulted Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI Codex on Apigee project placement strategy
- Resolved critical question: dedicated Apigee projects vs. reusing existing infrastructure
- Updated ADR 001 with correct project architecture reflecting existing 15 deployed projects
- Created comprehensive Terraform update specification for pcc-foundation-infra
- Documented AI consensus: create 2 new dedicated projects under pcc-fldr-si

### AI Consultation Results

**Question**: Should Apigee go in dedicated projects, devops projects, or systems projects?

**Gemini 2.5 Pro Recommendation**: Option A - Dedicated Projects
- "Apigee is a critical runtime environment, not a CI/CD tool or generic system utility"
- Clear ownership & security: platform team manages, app teams consume
- Independent scalability & quotas: prevents resource contention
- Simplified management: easier troubleshooting, networking, cost management
- Hub-and-spoke network pattern: Apigee hub, app projects as spokes

**OpenAI Codex Recommendation**: Option A - Dedicated Projects
- "Keeps Apigee runtimes isolated from CI/CD tooling and ambiguous 'systems' footprint"
- Clean IAM boundaries, targeted quotas, predictable billing
- Enterprise customers often dedicate Apigee org projects for clear governance
- Separation eases incident response, audit, and cost transparency

### Architectural Decision

**Create 2 New Dedicated Projects**:
- `pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod` (under pcc-fldr-si) → hosts nonprod Apigee org (devtest + dev)
- `pcc-prj-apigee-prod` (under pcc-fldr-si) → hosts prod Apigee org (staging + prod)

**Rationale**:
- Apigee is platform-level shared infrastructure (not app-specific)
- Clean separation of concerns: API gateway vs. CI/CD vs. app workloads
- Clear IAM boundaries: platform team manages Apigee, app teams consume APIs
- Isolated quotas: Apigee doesn't compete with Cloud Build or GKE resources
- Cost transparency: dedicated billing shows exact API platform spend
- Network clarity: hub-and-spoke pattern with proper blast radius

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated ADR 001 with correct project structure
- ✅ Added rationale for dedicated projects (AI consensus)
- ✅ Updated Terraform structure showing Phase 0 (foundation) + Phase 1 (Apigee)
- ✅ Created detailed Terraform update spec: `.claude/docs/pcc-foundation-infra-apigee-updates.md`
  - Exact terraform changes needed in pcc-foundation-infra/terraform/main.tf
  - IAM bindings for new projects
  - Deployment strategy (phased approach, Stage 3)
  - Validation steps and cost impact

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Existing Foundation** (pcc-foundation-infra):
- 15 GCP projects (220 resources, deployed 2025-10-03)
- Folder structure: pcc-fldr-si (shared), pcc-fldr-app (GKE), pcc-fldr-data (AlloyDB/BigQuery)
- Shared VPC architecture: 2 VPC hosts (nonprod/prod), 12 service projects

**Required Updates** (Phase 0):
- Add 2 projects to pcc-foundation-infra terraform
- Deploy via existing phased deployment process (Stage 3 - IAM bindings)
- Minimal impact: ~10 resources added, negligible cost

### Status
- ⏸️ ADR 001 and foundation update spec complete
- ⏳ Phase 1 plan still needs revision (1,590 lines assumes greenfield)
- ⏳ Foundation terraform updates not yet applied
- 🔄 Architectural decision finalized, ready for implementation planning

### Next Session
- Update Phase 1 plan to reflect integration with existing infrastructure
- Plan Phase 0 deployment (add projects to foundation)
- Continue Phase 2-8 planning with corrected architecture


---

## ⚠️ Session: 2025-10-17 13:30 EDT - Planning Reset & Archive (ACTIVE)

**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Type**: Project Management & Planning Reset
**Status**: ⚠️ PLANNING RESET - Starting fresh with correct requirements

### Critical Decision: Archive Existing Planning

**Problem Identified:**
- Phase 1 plan (1,607 lines) built on greenfield assumptions
- Referenced non-existent projects (pcc-dev, pcc-prod)
- Ignored 15 existing projects with 220 resources in pcc-foundation-infra
- Mixed foundation setup with Apigee deployment (too large, unfocused)
- Not executable in reasonable chunks (high risk, poor trackability)

**Decision:** Archive all existing planning, start fresh with correct context

### Archived Documents

**Location:** `.claude/plans/archived/`

**Archived Files:**
1. `master-plan-v1-8-phases.md` (44KB) - Original 8-phase plan with incorrect project assumptions
2. `phase-1-v1-greenfield-assumption.md` (59KB) - Phase 1 with greenfield setup
3. `phase-1a-architecture-design.md` (25KB) - Architecture design with wrong project names
4. `phase-1a-documentation-audit.md` (11KB) - CLAUDE.md audit
5. `phase-1a-gcp-preflight-checklist.md` (45KB) - Terraform guide with greenfield approach

**Total Archived:** ~190KB of planning that assumed wrong infrastructure

### Documents Retained (Correct & Useful)

**Architecture Decision Records:**
- ✅ `.claude/docs/ADR/001-two-org-apigee-architecture.md` (CORRECT)
  - Two Apigee organizations: nonprod (devtest+dev), prod (staging+prod)
  - Dedicated projects: pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod, pcc-prj-apigee-prod
  - Gemini + Codex consensus on dedicated project architecture

**Specifications:**
- ✅ `.claude/docs/pcc-foundation-infra-apigee-updates.md` (CORRECT - Phase 0 spec)
- ✅ `.claude/docs/apigee-x-networking-specification.md` (reference for VPC peering patterns)
- ✅ `.claude/docs/apigee-x-traffic-routing-specification.md` (reference for load balancers)

**Quick References:**
- ✅ `.claude/quick-reference/ai-cli-commands.md` (Gemini/Codex CLI integration)

### Current Infrastructure Understanding (Correct)

**Existing Foundation** (pcc-foundation-infra):
- 15 GCP projects deployed across folder hierarchy
- 220 resources (2025-10-03 deployment)
- Folders: pcc-fldr-si, pcc-fldr-app, pcc-fldr-data
- Network: 2 VPCs (prod/nonprod), 12 Shared VPC service projects
- Security: 9/10 score, production-ready

**New Projects Required:**
- `pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod` (under pcc-fldr-si)
- `pcc-prj-apigee-prod` (under pcc-fldr-si)

### Rationale for Fresh Start

**Why Retrofit Would Fail:**
1. 1,607 lines of incorrect assumptions throughout document
2. High risk of missing cascading changes
3. Project name references scattered everywhere
4. Network topology assumptions embedded in examples
5. GKE cluster references to non-existent clusters
6. Terraform module paths based on wrong repo structure

**Why Fresh Start Succeeds:**
1. Correct foundation understanding from start
2. Properly-sized phases (200-400 lines each)
3. Executable in 1-2 sessions per phase
4. Clear dependencies and prerequisites
5. Testable milestones
6. Lower error risk

### New Planning Approach

**Phase 0:** Add 2 Apigee projects to pcc-foundation-infra
- Specification: pcc-foundation-infra-apigee-updates.md
- Terraform updates to main.tf
- IAM bindings
- Deployment & validation

**Phase 1:** Deploy nonprod Apigee organization + devtest environment
- Requirements definition needed
- Focused scope (not entire pipeline)
- Clear success criteria
- Plan: 200-400 lines (not 1,607)

**Phase 2+:** TBD based on priorities

### Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Archive old planning documents
2. ⏳ Define actual requirements and priorities
3. ⏳ Create properly-sized Phase 1 plan
4. ⏳ Execute Phase 0 (foundation updates)

**Requirements Gathering:**
- Identify top 3 priorities
- Define success criteria per deliverable
- Map dependencies
- Size phases appropriately (1-2 session chunks)

### Status

- ✅ Planning archived
- ✅ Brief.md updated with clean slate status
- ✅ Current-progress.md updated (this entry)
- ⏳ Requirements gathering pending
- ⏳ New Phase 1 plan creation pending

### Key Lesson

**Large, unfocused plans with incorrect assumptions are worse than no plan.**

Better approach:
- Validate infrastructure understanding FIRST
- Create small, executable phases
- Test assumptions early
- Iterate based on reality

## 📋 Session: 2025-10-17 15:00 EDT - Apigee Subnet Allocation Clarification (COMPLETE)

**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Type**: Network Planning & Subnet Design
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Subnet allocations finalized and documented

### Accomplishments

**Subnet Structure Clarification:**
- Clarified that each /18 range (10.16.192.0/18 prod, 10.24.192.0/18 nonprod) comprises 4x /20 subnets
- Followed standard GKE allocation pattern: primary, secondary (pods), tertiary (services), overflow

**Apigee X Networking Requirements Analysis:**
- Researched Apigee X subnet requirements: /22 for runtime instances, /28 for management plane
- Identified over-provisioning strategy: /20 allocations exceed Apigee needs but maintain consistency
- Confirmed standard allocation pattern for infrastructure uniformity across GKE and Apigee projects

**Final Subnet Naming Convention:**
- Established naming: `pcc-prj-apigee-{environment}-{purpose}`
- Updated Google Spreadsheet with final allocations

### Subnet Allocations (Final)

**Production Apigee (pcc-prj-apigee-prod):**
- 10.16.192.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-prod-runtime
- 10.16.208.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-prod-management
- 10.16.224.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-prod-troubleshooting
- 10.16.240.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-prod-overflow

**NonProd Apigee (pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod):**
- 10.24.192.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod-runtime
- 10.24.208.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod-management
- 10.24.224.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod-troubleshooting
- 10.24.240.0/20 - pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod-overflow

### Technical Decisions

**Standard Allocation Pattern Rationale:**
1. **Consistency**: Matches GKE subnet structure (primary + pods + services + overflow)
2. **Over-provisioning**: /20 ranges exceed Apigee's /22 runtime + /28 management needs
3. **Future-proofing**: Reserved ranges for expansion, troubleshooting, TBD use cases
4. **Uniformity**: Simplifies infrastructure management across all GCP projects

**Apigee X vs GKE Networking Differences:**
- Apigee X is fully managed service (Google runs infrastructure)
- Does NOT use GKE-style secondary pod/service ranges
- Typical needs: /22 runtime, /28 management, optional /28 troubleshooting
- Allocated 4x /20s to maintain infrastructure-wide consistency

### Status File Updates

- ✅ Updated `.claude/status/brief.md` with subnet allocation details
- ✅ Updated `.claude/status/current-progress.md` (this entry)
- ✅ Google Spreadsheet updated with final subnet names
- ⏳ PDF subnet design document not yet updated (deferred)

### Next Session

**Ready for Phase 0 Planning:**
- Network allocation documented and finalized
- Ready to create detailed Phase 0 plan for adding 2 Apigee projects
- Phase 0 scope: Projects + folder assignment only (no subnets/APIs/IAM until later)
- All planning to remain documentation-only until 10/20

## 🤖 Session: 2025-10-18 16:07 EDT - Three-Way AI Consultation on Ingress Strategy (DECISION COMPLETE)

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Type**: Architecture Planning & Multi-AI Consultation
**Status**: ✅ DECISION COMPLETE - GKE Ingress + PSC selected

### Accomplishments

**Conducted comprehensive three-way AI consultation** (Claude + Gemini + Codex) on ADR-002: Apigee-GKE ingress strategy:
- Initial consultation: All 3 AIs recommended GCP Ingress + VPC Peering (operational simplicity)
- User challenged: "Why not NGINX + PSC from day 1 with AI assistance available?"
- Second consultation: Re-evaluated based on AI support changing complexity equation
- Analyzed Context7 documentation: 483 NGINX patterns, 446K GKE patterns

### Key Results

**✅ UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS: Private Service Connect (PSC) from Day 1**
- All 3 AI perspectives agree: Deploy PSC immediately, skip VPC peering
- Rationale: Better security, scalability, no IP overlap, avoids future migration
- AI assistance makes PSC setup trivial compared to VPC peering

**🔀 SPLIT DECISION: Ingress Layer**

*Gemini Position (NGINX + PSC):*
- AI assistance nullifies complexity barrier
- Building temporary GCP Ingress first is inefficient (build twice)
- Warns: "Black box ownership" - team must understand, not just use AI

*Codex Position (GKE Ingress + PSC):*
- AI reduces build effort but doesn't change ownership model
- No functional requirement TODAY that justifies NGINX overhead
- Team owns: 24/7 accountability, CVE patching, compliance, incident response
- Add NGINX later only if proven necessary (7 services = bounded migration)

*Claude Position (NGINX + PSC):*
- With AI support, NGINX operational overhead is manageable
- User expects to need it eventually ("Why not just use NGINX?")
- Original recommendations overcautious - optimized for "team alone" not "team with AI"

### Critical Insights

**AI Assistance Changes the Calculus:**
- Learning curve: Minutes (with AI) vs. weeks (without AI)
- Debugging: Guided diagnosis vs. trial-and-error
- Config generation: AI-generated vs. manual YAML writing
- Complexity management: Real-time expert help vs. Stack Overflow searching

**Risks AI Cannot Solve (Codex's Warning):**
- 24/7 on-call accountability (AI won't get paged at 3am)
- Security/compliance sign-off (human remains accountable)
- CVE patching decisions (go/no-go calls require judgment)
- Production incident command (human judgment required)
- "Black box ownership" (understanding vs. blind trust in AI configs)

### Decision Framework Provided

**Critical Question:** "Do you have CONCRETE routing requirements that GKE Ingress can't handle?"

**If YES (specific features needed):**
- Advanced path rewrites, per-user rate limiting, custom Lua scripts
- → **NGINX + PSC from day 1**

**If NO (or uncertain):**
- Simple prefix routing, standard JWT validation, basic rate limiting
- → **GKE Ingress + PSC first, add NGINX only if proven necessary**

### Tie-Breaker Questions for User

1. Can you name 2-3 specific routing patterns GKE Ingress can't handle?
2. Does your team have prior NGINX operational experience?
3. Are you more afraid of: Building wrong architecture initially? or Taking on unnecessary operational burden?
4. What's your timeline pressure? (Tight 1 week → GKE Ingress, Comfortable 2+ weeks → NGINX)

### Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Comprehensive three-way AI consultation conducted
- ✅ Unanimous agreement on PSC from day 1
- ✅ Clear decision framework provided with tie-breaker questions
- ✅ Documented risks AI cannot mitigate (operational ownership)
- ✅ Handoff created: `.claude/handoffs/Claude-2025-10-18-16-07.md`
- ✅ Brief.md updated with current session status

**User Decision (2025-10-18 20:15 EDT):**
- Selected: **GKE Ingress + PSC**
- Rationale: No concrete requirement today for NGINX features, operational simplicity preferred
- Flexible: Can pivot to NGINX + PSC if backend dev identifies need for advanced rewrites
- Aligns with Codex recommendation: "AI reduces build effort but doesn't change ownership model"

**Completed:**
- ✅ ADR-002 updated with GKE Ingress + PSC decision
- ✅ PSC architecture section added (unanimous AI consensus rationale)
- ✅ Implementation details updated (PSC service attachment, PSC endpoint, GKE Ingress)

## 📝 Session: 2025-10-18 16:25 EDT - Documentation Alignment Complete

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Type**: Architecture Documentation Updates
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All docs aligned with GKE Ingress + PSC decision

### Accomplishments

**Documentation Audit & Updates:**
- Audited all 9 phases in devtest-deployment-phases.md for outdated NGINX/VPC peering references
- Systematically replaced all VPC peering references with PSC
- Removed all NGINX references from active sections (retained only in changelog)
- Ensured GKE Ingress + PSC architecture consistently documented throughout

**Files Updated:**
1. `.claude/docs/ADR/002-apigee-gke-ingress-strategy.md`:
   - Added "Impacted Phases" section (lines 201-247)
   - Documents which phases need updates if pivot to NGINX
   - Estimated pivot effort: 2-3 hours
   - Clear roadmap for future modifications

2. `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment-phases.md`:
   - Phase 1 (line 94): VPC peering → PSC/service networking
   - Phase 7 Section 9 (lines 514-538): Complete rewrite for GKE Ingress + PSC
     - PSC service attachment (GKE side)
     - PSC endpoint (Apigee side, IP 10.24.200.10)
     - GKE Ingress configuration (gce-internal class)
     - Backend target via HTTPS to PSC endpoint
   - Phase 7 Deliverables (line 546): Updated for PSC + GKE Ingress
   - Phase 7 Validation (lines 558-568): Updated routing path
   - Phase 8 (line 587): PSC reference updated
   - Review notes (lines 779-789): Documented complete Phase 7 rewrite

**Verification:**
- ✅ No orphaned NGINX references in active sections
- ✅ No VPC peering references (except historical changelog)
- ✅ PSC endpoint IP (10.24.200.10) used consistently
- ✅ GKE Ingress specified throughout active documentation

### User Questions Answered

**Q**: "Why does ADR-002 say 'Phase 3: NEW - Add NGINX deployment'?"
**A**: That's in the "Impacted Phases (for Future Updates)" section - conditional roadmap showing what would change IF decision pivots to NGINX. It's documentation of potential future work, not current work. Clarified that this is future-only guidance.

### Phase Subnets Documented

**Phase 1 (GKE devtest cluster)**:
- 10.28.0.0/20 (nodes)
- 10.28.16.0/20 (pods)
- 10.28.32.0/20 (services)
- 10.28.48.0/20 (overflow)

**Phase 7 (Apigee nonprod)**:
- 10.24.192.0/20 (runtime)
- 10.24.208.0/20 (management)
- 10.24.224.0/20 (troubleshooting)
- 10.24.240.0/20 (overflow)

### Current Architecture (Final)

```
Internet → External HTTPS LB → PSC NEG → Apigee Runtime
Apigee Runtime → PSC Endpoint (10.24.200.10) → PSC Tunnel → GKE Internal HTTP(S) LB → GKE Ingress → Services
```

### Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ All documentation aligned with GKE Ingress + PSC decision
- ✅ Clear pivot path documented if requirements change
- ✅ Handoff created: `.claude/handoffs/Claude-2025-10-18-16-25.md`
- ✅ Brief.md updated with latest handoff reference

**Pending:**
- ⏳ Backend dev feedback on NGINX requirements (can change plan if needed)
- ⏳ Weekend planning continues (10/18-10/19): Documentation only
- ⏳ Implementation starts 10/20+

### Next Session

**Planning Focus (10/18-10/19):**
- Phase 0 detailed planning (add 2 Apigee projects to foundation)
- Refine Phase 1-8 plans with GKE Ingress + PSC architecture
- All work remains planning/documentation (no terraform apply until 10/20)

**If Backend Requirements Change:**
- Use ADR-002 "Impacted Phases" as update guide
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours to pivot all docs to NGINX + PSC

## 📝 Session: 2025-10-18 16:58 EDT - Phase Breakdown Planning

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Phase 0 & Phase 1 subphases approved and documented

### Accomplishments

**Phase Breakdown Structure Established**:
- ✅ Created Phase 0 subphases (0.1-0.4): Foundation project creation planning
- ✅ Added Phase 0.5: WARP deployment (terraform apply execution)
- ✅ Approved Phase 1 subphases (1.1-1.5): Networking for devtest
  - 1.1: GKE subnet config (10.28.0.0/20 + 3 secondary ranges)
  - 1.2: PSC for AlloyDB (10.29.0.0/20 from subnet allocation PDF)
  - 1.3: Firewall rules + AlloyDB Auth Proxy for developers
  - 1.4: Terraform validation (fmt, validate, plan)
  - 1.5: WARP deployment (terraform apply)

**Key Decisions**:
- Terraform approach: Foundation work stays in pcc-foundation-infra (no library modules needed)
- PSC IP range: 10.29.0.0/20 (confirmed from GCP_Network_Subnets.pdf - currently unallocated)
- WARP: Zsh terminal with AI assistance, same terraform commands
- Path convention: Use relative paths (`.claude/` or `$HOME/pcc/.claude/`)
- Documentation flow: Get user approval BEFORE creating subphase docs (lesson learned)

**Standard Subphase Pattern**:
- X.1-X.3: Planning subphases (design, document terraform/configs)
- X.4: Validation (terraform fmt, validate, plan - spell out all commands)
- X.5: Deployment via WARP (list terraform apply commands, note testing limitations based on backend dependencies)

**Files Created**:
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-0.1.md` (review foundation repo)
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-0.2.md` (plan terraform)
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-0.3.md` (validate terraform)
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-0.4.md` (document prerequisites)
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-0.5.md` (WARP deploy - NEW)
- `.claude/handoffs/Claude-2025-10-18-16-58.md` (this session)

### Process Corrections

**User Feedback Incorporated**:
- Don't create documentation before approval (wait for user review of structure)
- Always use relative paths in documentation
- Phase X.4: Spell out terraform validation commands in detail
- Phase X.5: Note what can/cannot be tested (backend dependencies)
  - Example: Cannot test PSC or Auth Proxy in Phase 1.5 since AlloyDB doesn't exist until Phase 2
- WARP sections: "Switch to WARP terminal, run: [list commands]"

### Current Architecture (Unchanged)

```
Internet → External HTTPS LB → PSC NEG → Apigee Runtime
Apigee Runtime → PSC Endpoint (10.24.200.10) → PSC Tunnel → GKE Internal HTTP(S) LB → GKE Ingress → Services
```

### Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 0 subphases: 5 docs created (0.1-0.5)
- ✅ Phase 1 subphases: Structure approved (ready to document)
- ✅ Subnet allocation confirmed: 10.29.0.0/20 for PSC (from GCP_Network_Subnets.pdf)
- ✅ Handoff created: `.claude/handoffs/Claude-2025-10-18-16-58.md`

**Pending:**
- ⏳ Phase 1 documentation: Create 5 docs (phase-1.1.md through phase-1.5.md) - NEXT
- ⏳ Phase 2-8 breakdown: Present for approval, then document
- ⏳ Backend dev feedback on NGINX requirements (can pivot if needed)

### Next Session

**Immediate Actions (10/18-10/19):**
1. Create Phase 1 subphase docs (phase-1.1.md through phase-1.5.md)
2. Present Phase 2 subphase breakdown for approval
3. Continue through Phases 3-8 (approval → documentation pattern)

**Planning Period Reminder:**
- NO terraform generation until 10/20
- NO implementation work until 10/20
- Weekend: Planning and documentation ONLY
