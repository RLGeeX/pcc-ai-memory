## Session: 2025-10-15 20:19 EDT - Apigee Pipeline Planning

**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Type**: Architecture Planning

### Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive 8-phase Apigee pipeline implementation plan using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Documented complete CI/CD architecture: GitHub â†’ Cloud Build (9 steps) â†’ Docker/ArgoCD/Apigee
- Covered all 7 microservices (auth, client, user, metric-builder, metric-tracker, task-builder, task-tracker)
- Plan includes Terraform configs, pipeline scripts, K8s manifests, POC strategy, and multi-env roadmap
- Saved to `.claude/plans/apigee-pipeline-implementation-plan.md`

### Key Decisions
- Centralized pipeline library (pcc-pipeline-library) with 5 reusable bash scripts
- ArgoCD GitOps deployment pattern
- OpenAPI spec generation with service-specific path filtering
- Service onboarding target: â‰¤15 minutes per service
- Initial deployment to devtest environment only

### Status
- Plan approved and documented
- Implementation has NOT started
- Awaiting user selection of starting phase

### Next Session
- User to decide: Phase 1 (Terraform), Phase 2 (Scripts), Phase 3 (ArgoCD), Phase 4 (POC), or Sequential
- Begin implementation based on plan
- Track multi-step tasks with TodoWrite

## Session: 2025-10-15 20:33 EDT - Detailed Phase Planning Setup

**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Type**: Planning Methodology

### Accomplishments
- Corrected plan location: moved to `.claude/plans/` (not `.claude/reference/`)
- Removed Swashbuckle assumptions (.NET 10 incompatibility)
- Updated `generate-spec.sh` to find pre-built OpenAPI specs (not generate)
- Established hybrid planning approach: local subagents + Zen MCP synthesis
- Created TodoWrite workflow for 8 phase-specific detailed plans

### Key Decisions
- Use agent-organizer to analyze each phase requirements
- Launch parallel specialist subagents (cloud-architect, deployment-engineer, etc.)
- Synthesize with Zen planner (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for comprehensive output
- Create 8 phase-specific markdown files in `.claude/plans/`
- Process phases sequentially (1-7), not all at once

### Status
- Master plan updated and corrected
- Ready to begin Phase 1 detailed planning with subagents
- Task interrupted by user before agent-organizer completed

### Next Session
- Resume Phase 1 analysis with agent-organizer
- Launch recommended specialist subagents in parallel
- Synthesize Phase 1 detailed plan with Zen MCP
- Create `.claude/plans/phase-1-foundation-infrastructure.md`

## Session: 2025-10-15 21:51 EDT - Phase 1a Terraform-First Correction

**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Type**: Planning Review & Course Correction

### Accomplishments
- Completed Phase 1a specialist analysis with 3 parallel subagents:
  - cloud-architect: GCP infrastructure architecture (25KB, Terraform examples) âœ“
  - deployment-engineer: GCP pre-flight checklist (24KB, gcloud CLI commands) âœ—
  - documentation-expert: CLAUDE.md audit (identified 0% Apigee coverage) âœ“
- Attempted Zen MCP synthesis via clink tool (gemini/codex CLIs) - both failed
- **Critical discovery**: deployment-engineer used wrong approach (manual CLI instead of Terraform IaC)

### Key Decisions
- **Terraform-First Mandate**: All GCP infrastructure MUST use Terraform (infrastructure-as-code)
- Discard `phase-1a-gcp-preflight-checklist.md` (violates IaC principles)
- Keep `phase-1a-architecture-design.md` (has good Terraform examples)
- Re-run deployment-engineer with explicit Terraform-first instructions
- User clarified: CLAUDE.md is generic repo file, not Apigee-specific (documentation updates go elsewhere)

### Issue Identified
deployment-engineer created manual provisioning guide with:
- `gcloud services enable`, `gcloud artifacts repositories create`
- `kubectl create namespace`, `gsutil mb` (GCS bucket)
- `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` (IAM roles)

**Correct approach should be:**
1. Terraform modules in `core/pcc-tf-library/modules/` (apigee-iam, artifact-registry, secret-manager, gcs-bucket)
2. Terraform configs in `infra/pcc-app-shared-infra/terraform/`
3. gcloud/kubectl ONLY for post-deployment validation

### Zen MCP Tool Issues
- `mcp__zen__clink` with gemini CLI: "Error when talking to Gemini API" (empty stdout)
- `mcp__zen__clink` with codex CLI: "Not inside a trusted directory" error
- Workaround: Manual synthesis or fix Zen MCP configuration

### Status
- Phase 1a needs redo with Terraform-first approach
- Updated todos to reflect deployment-engineer redo
- All planning work is documentation-only (no infrastructure changes)

### Next Session
- Re-run deployment-engineer with Terraform-focused prompt
- Synthesize Phase 1 from architecture + new Terraform guide
- Create `.claude/plans/phase-1-foundation-infrastructure.md`
- Continue to Phase 2-7 planning

## Session: 2025-10-16 10:15 EDT - AI CLI Integration Strategy

**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Type**: Tooling Investigation & Documentation

### Accomplishments
- Investigated zen-mcp clink integration issues for gemini and codex CLIs
- Diagnosed root causes: Gemini OAuth vs API key conflict, Codex trust directory issue
- Validated both CLIs work perfectly when called directly via Bash
- Established direct CLI integration strategy for subagent consultation
- Created comprehensive documentation: `.claude/quick-reference/ai-cli-commands.md`
  - Gemini: OAuth setup, heredoc examples, architecture planning patterns
  - Codex: exec mode, trust flags, code review workflows
  - Integration patterns for subagents calling external CLIs via Bash
  - Best practices, troubleshooting, PCC-specific examples

### Key Decisions
**Direct CLI Integration (Bypass MCP):**
- Zen-mcp clink has known limitations with Gemini CLI (documented in zen-mcp-server)
- Direct Bash calls provide immediate functionality, transparency, no config debugging
- Subagents have Bash access and can autonomously consult gemini/codex
- Workflow: `Me â†’ subagent â†’ CLI (gemini/codex) â†’ subagent â†’ synthesis â†’ Me`

### Status
- Tooling strategy resolved and documented
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1a deployment-engineer redo using direct CLI calls
- All planning work is documentation-only (no infrastructure changes)

### Next Session
- Launch deployment-engineer with Terraform-first mandate
- Have subagent call gemini/codex directly for Terraform provisioning guide
- Synthesize Phase 1 plan from architecture + new Terraform guide
- Continue Phase 2-7 planning with validated CLI integration approach

## Session: 2025-10-16 12:01 EDT - Phase 1 Completion & Codex Review

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Type**: Architecture Planning & Documentation

### Accomplishments
- Launched deployment-engineer with Terraform-first mandate using direct gemini CLI integration
- Completely rewrote Terraform provisioning guide (v2.0, 1,852 lines in `.claude/plans/`)
- Synthesized comprehensive Phase 1 plan (530 lines in `.claude/plans/`)
- Conducted Codex review of Phase 1 plan (9 critical findings)
- Created Apigee X Networking Specification (55KB in `.claude/docs/`) addressing VPC peering, service networking, Cloud NAT, IP ranges
- Created Apigee X Traffic Routing Specification (67KB in `.claude/docs/`) covering external HTTPS load balancers, Google-managed certificates, environment groups
- Updated Phase 1 plan with networking references and production requirements roadmap
- Moved all planning docs to `.claude/docs/` per project structure guidelines

### Key Decisions
- **4 Separate Apigee Organizations Architecture**: Complete project isolation (devtestâ†’pcc-devtest, devâ†’pcc-dev, stagingâ†’pcc-staging, prodâ†’pcc-prod)
- **100% Terraform Infrastructure**: Zero manual provisioning, all infrastructure as code
- **Phase 1 Planning Complete**: All specifications, modules, configs, and deployment procedures documented
- **Implementation Deferred**: User clarified we're in planning-only mode until ALL phases (1-8) have detailed plans

### Status
- Phase 1 planning 100% complete with all Codex findings addressed
- Ready to begin Phase 2-8 detailed planning
- No implementation work will begin until comprehensive planning for all phases is complete
- All documentation organized in `.claude/plans/` directory

### Next Session
- Begin Phase 2 detailed planning (Pipeline Library & Cloud Build)
- Continue through Phases 3-8 planning sequentially
- Use specialist subagents + AI CLI consultation for each phase
- Create phase-specific markdown documents for each phase
