# Session Handoff: Phase 4 ArgoCD Planning - Agent-Organizer Reviews

## Project Context
- Working on Phase 4 (ArgoCD dual-cluster deployment) planning for PortCo Connect devtest environment
- Creating comprehensive subphase documents for wife to execute while user plans ahead
- Parallel workflow: Wife executing Phase 2 (AlloyDB), user planning Phase 4

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Read Phase 3 overview, identified namespace inconsistency (corrected: `pcc-devtest` in Phase 6, not Phase 3.6)
- ✅ Split Phase 4.1 into 4.1A/B/C subphases (architecture, security, repository planning)
- ✅ Split Phase 4.2 into 4.2A/B (Helm values planning + GCP terraform)
- ✅ Updated phase numbering (now 12 total subphases instead of 9)
- ✅ **Agent-organizer review for Phase 4.1A**: Feedback incorporated into working notes
- ✅ **Agent-organizer review for Phase 4.2A**: 8 issues identified (3 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM)
  - Redis persistence: RDB snapshots, 10GB PVC, backup/restore procedures
  - Dex session storage: Redis backing (not in-memory)
  - Resource requests/limits: All components specified
  - Complete ingress configuration: GKE Ingress, Google-managed SSL, Cloud Armor
  - ArgoCD version: v3.1.9 selected with rationale
- ✅ **Agent-organizer review for Phase 4.2B**: Key decisions documented
  - Repository: infra/pcc-app-shared-infra (existing)
  - File: argocd-ingress.tf (8 GCP resources)
  - DNS ordering critical: DNS → SSL certs (targeted applies)
  - Added SSL policy for TLS 1.2+ enforcement

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Review Phase 4.1B (Security & Access Planning) with agent-organizer
- [ ] Review Phase 4.1C (Repository & Integration Planning) with agent-organizer
- [ ] Review remaining phases 4.3-4.9 with agent-organizer
- [ ] Create individual phase documents after all reviews complete

## Next Steps
1. Continue agent-organizer reviews for phases 4.1B, 4.1C, and 4.3-4.9
2. OR start implementation of Phase 4.2A/4.2B (planning complete, ready for execution)
3. Update `.claude/status/brief.md` at session end

## Key Architectural Decisions Locked In
- **ArgoCD version**: v3.1.9 (both clusters)
- **HA configuration**: 3 API servers, 2 repo servers, 3 Redis (prod only)
- **Persistence**: Redis PVC with RDB snapshots + daily Cloud Storage backups
- **Dex storage**: Redis backing store for session survivability
- **Ingress**: GKE Ingress with Google-managed SSL, Cloud Armor DDoS protection
- **DNS naming**: Regional suffix (-east4) for future Active/Active
- **RBAC**: Namespace-aware (gcp-developers get admin only in pcc-devtest)
- **Terraform**: 8 GCP resources in infra/pcc-app-shared-infra/terraform/argocd-ingress.tf

## References
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-4-working-notes.md` (comprehensive, updated with all feedback)
- `.claude/plans/devtest-deployment/phase-3-subphases.md` (corrected namespace references)
- `.claude/status/current-progress.md` (session history)
- `.claude/status/brief.md` (last updated PCC-98 complete, Phase 2.7 security audit)

## Metadata
- **Session Duration**: ~4.5 hours
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-22 14:27 EDT
- **Status**: Phase 4 planning 25% complete (3 of 12 subphases reviewed)
- **Token Usage**: 124k/200k (62% available)
