# Session Handoff: Phase 4 ArgoCD Planning - Phase 4.3 Design Complete

## Project Context
- Continuing Phase 4 (ArgoCD dual-cluster deployment) planning for PortCo Connect devtest environment
- Creating comprehensive subphase documents via agent-organizer reviews for quality assurance
- Using brainstorming skill to design execution-ready documentation for AI consumption
- Total: 12 subphases (4.1A/B/C, 4.2A/B, 4.3-4.9)

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Phase 4.1C Corrections Applied**: All user feedback incorporated
  - GitHub App with Workload Identity (no SSH keys needed)
  - Secret Manager credentials mounted to GKE pods
  - Google Cloud Observability only (no Prometheus/Grafana)
  - 7 alert thresholds based on ArgoCD community best practices (researched via Context7 + Tavily)
  - Quarterly credential rotation, 7-day Cloud Storage snapshots
- ✅ **Phase 4.3 Complete Design**: Used brainstorming skill for structured approach
  - Three modular sections: Pre-flight Checks → Helm Deployment → Component Verification
  - AI-consumable structure (not copy-paste for humans)
  - Essential validations only (nonprod environment)
  - GKE Ingress with Google-managed SSL (consistent with Phase 4.2B)
  - Happy path only (no rollback procedures in doc)
- ✅ **Agent-organizer Review**: Phase 4.3 approved with GO recommendation
  - All 25 original issues RESOLVED (7 CRITICAL, 8 HIGH, 10 MEDIUM)
  - 6 minor new issues identified (1 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 2 LOW) - none are blockers
  - Production-ready and executable as written
- ✅ **Updated Status Files**: Brief.md and working notes review tracking updated

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] **Phase 4.4-4.9 Reviews**: 6 remaining subphases to review with agent-organizer
  - 4.4: Configure & Test ArgoCD Nonprod
  - 4.5: Install ArgoCD Prod
  - 4.6: Configure Cluster Management
  - 4.7: Configure GitHub Integration
  - 4.8: Configure App-of-Apps Pattern
  - 4.9: Validate Full Deployment
- [ ] **Optional**: Apply 6 minor cosmetic fixes to Phase 4.3 (section numbering, SSL cert positioning)
- [ ] **Final Review**: Review complete Phase 4 plan with Codex and Gemini when all subphases done

## Next Steps
**Option 1**: Continue reviews with Phase 4.4 using brainstorming skill
**Option 2**: Quick polish Phase 4.3 cosmetic issues (~5-10 min)
**Option 3**: Pivot to Phase 2 execution (PCC-99: Terraform validation for AlloyDB)

**Recommended**: Continue to Phase 4.4 with brainstorming skill to maintain momentum

## Key Architectural Decisions Locked In
- **ArgoCD version**: v3.1.9 (Helm chart v7.7.4)
- **GitHub integration**: GitHub App with Workload Identity (no SSH keys)
- **Monitoring**: Google Cloud Observability, 7 alert policies
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE, JWT validation, quarterly rotation
- **Backup**: 7-day Redis PVC snapshots (prod only)
