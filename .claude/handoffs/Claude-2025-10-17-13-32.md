# Session Handoff: Apigee Planning Reset & Requirements Gathering

## Project Context

Working on Apigee X deployment planning for PortCo Connect (PCC) API gateway infrastructure. Critical architectural decision made: create 2 dedicated Apigee projects under pcc-fldr-si (shared infrastructure folder) instead of reusing existing devops/systems projects. Archived ~190KB of planning documents that assumed greenfield infrastructure when 15 projects (220 resources) already exist in pcc-foundation-infra.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ **Architectural Decision Finalized**: Consulted Gemini 2.5 Pro + OpenAI Codex, both strongly recommended dedicated projects (pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod, pcc-prj-apigee-prod) for clean IAM boundaries, quota isolation, cost transparency
- ✅ **ADR 001 Updated**: Corrected GCP project structure (15 existing + 2 new), documented two-organization architecture (nonprod org: devtest+dev, prod org: staging+prod)
- ✅ **Phase 0 Specification Created**: pcc-foundation-infra-apigee-updates.md with exact Terraform changes needed to add 2 Apigee projects to foundation
- ✅ **Planning Archive**: Moved 5 incorrect planning documents (1,607-line Phase 1 plan, 8-phase master plan, phase-1a documents) to `.claude/plans/archived/` - all assumed greenfield setup with non-existent pcc-dev/pcc-prod projects
- ✅ **Status Files Updated**: brief.md reflects planning reset, current-progress.md has full session history
- ✅ **Reference Cleanup**: Removed `.claude/reference/feedback` folder (unused)

## Pending Tasks

- ⏳ **Requirements Definition**: Define top 3 priorities for Apigee deployment (Apigee nonprod org? Pipeline? Networking?)
- ⏳ **Phase 0 Execution**: Apply Terraform changes to pcc-foundation-infra/terraform/main.tf to create 2 new Apigee projects
- ⏳ **Focused Phase 1 Plan**: Create new plan (200-400 lines, not 1,607) for deploying nonprod Apigee organization + devtest environment only
- ⏳ **Terraform Repository Decision**: New pcc-apigee-infra repo vs. extend existing pcc-app-shared-infra?
- ⏳ **Network Integration Planning**: VPC peering from Apigee projects to existing network infrastructure (2 VPCs, 12 Shared VPC service projects)

## Next Steps

1. **Define Requirements & Priorities**: Identify top 3 deliverables needed first (suggest: nonprod Apigee org deployment as Phase 1 focus)
2. **Review Phase 0 Specification**: `.claude/docs/pcc-foundation-infra-apigee-updates.md` has complete Terraform code for adding 2 projects to foundation
3. **Execute Phase 0**: Update pcc-foundation-infra terraform, run plan/apply, validate 2 new projects created
4. **Create Focused Phase 1 Plan**: Small, executable plan for nonprod Apigee org only (not entire 8-phase pipeline)
5. **Iterate**: Build subsequent phases based on actual needs, not assumptions

- `.claude/docs/pcc-foundation-infra-apigee-updates.md` - Phase 0 Terraform specification (READY TO EXECUTE)

**Archived Planning (Reference Only):**
- `.claude/plans/archived/` - Old planning with incorrect assumptions (5 files, 190KB)

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- `pcc-foundation-infra/terraform/main.tf` - 15 projects defined (220 resources deployed)
- `pcc-foundation-infra/.claude/status/brief.md` - Current foundation state (2025-10-03 deployment)

## Key Decisions & Context

**Why Planning Reset?**
- Original Phase 1 plan (1,607 lines) referenced non-existent pcc-dev/pcc-prod projects
- Mixed foundation setup with Apigee deployment (too large, unfocused)
- Better to start fresh with correct infrastructure understanding than retrofit incorrect assumptions

**Architectural Decision:**
- **Two Apigee Organizations**: nonprod (devtest+dev) in pcc-prj-apigee-nonprod, prod (staging+prod) in pcc-prj-apigee-prod
- **Dedicated Projects**: Under pcc-fldr-si (shared infrastructure), separate from app/data/devops projects
- **AI Consensus**: Gemini + Codex both strongly recommended this approach for clean IAM, quotas, billing

**Current Infrastructure (Correct Understanding):**
- 15 GCP projects already deployed in pcc-foundation-infra
- Folders: pcc-fldr-si (shared), pcc-fldr-app (GKE), pcc-fldr-data (databases)
- Network: 2 VPCs (prod/nonprod), 12 Shared VPC service projects
- Security: 9/10 score, production-ready foundation

**Phase 0 vs Phase 1:**
- **Phase 0**: Add 2 Apigee projects to pcc-foundation-infra (foundation updates) - specification complete
- **Phase 1**: Deploy nonprod Apigee org + devtest environment (Apigee infrastructure) - needs focused plan

## Blockers & Issues

**None** - Clear path forward, correct understanding of infrastructure, requirements gathering is next step.
