# Session Handoff: Phase 4 ArgoCD Planning - Critical Fixes & Full GO Approval

## Project Context
- Continuing Phase 4 (ArgoCD dual-cluster deployment) planning for PortCo Connect devtest environment
- Session focused on fixing critical issues in newly designed phases 4.2C, 4.5A, and 4.5B
- All fixes applied and verified by agent-organizer with FULL GO recommendation

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ **All 7 Critical/High Issues Fixed** (2 CRITICAL, 5 HIGH severity):
  - CRITICAL-1 & CRITICAL-2: Corrected Redis HA to use `redis-ha` subchart with Sentinel (lines 2027-2074)
  - HIGH-1: Deferred backup automation to Phase 4.6 with clear scope documentation (lines 2404-2474)
  - HIGH-2: Clarified terraform state management with conditional guidance (lines 1681-1689)
  - HIGH-3: Fixed Ingress annotation to `ingress.gke.io/pre-shared-cert` (line 2262)
  - HIGH-4: Updated all pod count docs for redis-ha chart structure (multiple sections)
  - FINAL: Fixed redis-ha label selectors to use `app.kubernetes.io/component` (lines 2205-2212)
- ✅ **Agent-organizer Verification**: FULL GO approval received (95%+ confidence)
- ✅ **Phase Status**: 4.2C, 4.5A, 4.5B now production-ready and approved for execution
- ✅ **User Clarification**: NO 24-hour stabilization wait required between phases

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] **Continue Phase 4 Reviews**: 4 remaining subphases to review (4.5-4.9) with agent-organizer
- [ ] **Optional Alternative**: Pivot to Phase 2 execution (PCC-99: Terraform validation for AlloyDB)
- [ ] **Final Review**: Review complete Phase 4 plan with Codex and Gemini when all subphases done

## Next Steps
**Option 1**: Continue reviews with next subphase using brainstorming skill pattern
**Option 2**: Pivot to Phase 2 execution (PCC-99: AlloyDB Terraform validation)
**Option 3**: Begin executing Phase 4 (terraform + deployments now have FULL GO)

**Recommended**: Await user decision on next direction

## Key Architectural Decisions (Locked In)
- ArgoCD v3.1.9 (Helm chart v7.7.4), both clusters
- Redis HA: `redis-ha` subchart with 3 Sentinel replicas, 3 HAProxy replicas
- Backup: Deferred to Phase 4.6 (Cloud Storage bucket + CronJob + IAM)
- Terraform state: Shared GCS backend with environment-based resource naming
- Ingress: `ingress.gke.io/pre-shared-cert` for terraform-created certificates
- Pod count: 15 total (3 API, 2 repo, 1 controller, 2 Dex, 1 applicationset, 3 redis-ha-server, 3 redis-ha-haproxy)
