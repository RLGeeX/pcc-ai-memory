# Session Handoff: Phase 1-2 PSC Architecture Restructure

## Project Context
- Working on devtest deployment planning for PCC Foundation Infrastructure
- **Key Decision**: Moved PSC endpoint ownership from foundation (Phase 1) to AlloyDB infrastructure (Phase 2)
- Foundation (existing 220 resources) enhancement, NOT greenfield
- Implementation scheduled for 10/20+

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1 Restructure (Network Infrastructure)
- ✅ Added firewall rules consideration to Phase 1.2 (deferred to Phase 5 with GKE)
- ✅ Deleted Phase 1.3 (PSC IP reservation) - no longer needed
- ✅ Renamed Phase 1.4 → 1.3 (Terraform validation, expects 4 resources)
- ✅ Renamed Phase 1.5 → 1.4 (WARP deployment, removed manual state backup)
- ✅ Updated all cross-references between Phase 1 files

### Phase 2 Restructure (AlloyDB Infrastructure)
- ✅ Updated Phase 2.1: Removed Phase 1.3 references, PSC endpoint now "created in Phase 2.3"
- ✅ Updated Phase 2.2: Removed `psc_endpoint_ip` variable, added `psc_service_attachment_link` output
- ✅ Updated Phase 2.3: Added `google_compute_forwarding_rule` resource for PSC endpoint
  - PSC endpoint created AFTER AlloyDB cluster
  - References cluster's service attachment link
  - Uses static IP 10.28.48.10 from overflow subnet
  - Created in `pcc-prj-net-shared` (network project)

### AI Agent Review
- ✅ Codex reviewed Phase 1 files with scope context - **No issues found**
- ✅ Gemini review produced false positives (hallucinated content)
- ✅ Verified resource counts: 4 operations (2 adds, 2 destroy/recreate)
- ✅ Confirmed PSC endpoint creation correctly deferred to Phase 2

## Pending Tasks
- None blocking - All Phase 1-2 restructure work complete
- Phase 3-8 subphase planning on backlog (not started)

## Architecture Summary

**Before** (incorrect):
- Phase 1.3 reserved static IP for PSC endpoint
- Phase 2 looked up IP via data source
- Chicken-egg problem: PSC before AlloyDB

**After** (correct):
- Phase 1: Creates network space only (overflow subnet 10.28.48.0/20)
- Phase 2: Creates AlloyDB cluster, then PSC endpoint (10.28.48.10)
- PSC forwarding rule references cluster's service attachment
- Clean separation of concerns, no data source needed

## Key Decisions Made
- **PSC Ownership**: AlloyDB terraform (Phase 2), not foundation
- **Foundation Scope**: Network infrastructure only (4 resources)
- **State Management**: Rely on GCS versioning, no manual backups
- **Firewall Rules**: Deferred to Phase 5 with GKE deployment
- **Resource Count**: 4 total (2 subnet replacements + 2 new subnets)

## Next Steps
1. **If implementing Phase 0-1 (10/20+)**: Execute phases sequentially
   - Navigate to `~/pcc/core/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform`
   - Follow phase-0.1.md → 0.4.md (Apigee projects)
   - Then phase-1.2.md → 1.4.md (network infrastructure)
2. **If continuing planning**: Create Phase 3-8 subphase documents (present structure first)
3. **Validation**: Review `terraform plan` output during Phase 1.3 execution to confirm 4 resources

## Critical Context
- **Planning-only mode until 10/20** - No terraform apply yet
- **Phase 0**: Empty Apigee projects only (NO APIs, NO IAM until Phase 7)
- **Phase 1**: Network infrastructure (4 resources: 2 renames, 2 new subnets)
- **Phase 2**: AlloyDB cluster + PSC endpoint (PSC now owned by AlloyDB)
- **Overflow Subnet**: Provides network space for PSC at 10.28.48.10 (created in Phase 2.3)

## Metadata
- **Session Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-19 10:01 EDT
- **Main Achievement**: Completed Phase 1-2 PSC architecture restructure, all files updated and validated
