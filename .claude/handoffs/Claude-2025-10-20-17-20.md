# Session Handoff: Phase 3 Architecture Corrections & Phase Renumbering

## Project Context
- Working on devtest deployment phases documentation for PortCo Connect Apigee X pipeline
- Focus: Correcting Phase 3 (GKE Clusters) to remove service-specific infrastructure
- Changed first service from pcc-auth-api to pcc-client-api per user request

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Updated `devtest-deployment-phases.md` with corrected architecture:
  - Phase 3: Now only GKE clusters + shared IAM (removed 7 service accounts, Workload Identity bindings)
  - New Phase 6: Service Infrastructure (pcc-client-api) - service account, Workload Identity, IAM
  - Phase 7: First Service Deployment (pcc-client-api) - was Phase 6
  - Phase 8: Apigee - was Phase 7
  - Phase 9: External LB - was Phase 8
  - New Phase 10: Remaining Services (Placeholder)
- ✅ Updated all references from pcc-auth-api to pcc-client-api throughout phases
- ✅ Fixed cross-project IAM bindings: Removed Cloud Build → GKE (ArgoCD handles deployments)
- ✅ Updated developer RBAC from `view` to `edit` role (can exec, port-forward, debug)
- ✅ Fixed all repository paths (removed `pcc/` prefix - already in /home/jfogarty/pcc)
- ✅ Updated dependencies diagram and success criteria

## Pending Tasks
- ⏳ Create individual phase-3.1.md through phase-3.7.md files (7 subphases, not 9)
  - 3.1: Review existing infrastructure
  - 3.2: GKE cluster terraform
  - 3.3: Cross-project IAM bindings (4 patterns)
  - 3.4: Terraform validation
  - 3.5: WARP deployment
  - 3.6: ArgoCD namespace manifests
  - 3.7: RBAC configuration
- ⏳ Delete `phase-3-subphases.md` temporary planning file

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Service accounts are service-specific**, not shared infrastructure
   - Each service's infra repo creates its own SA (e.g., `infra/pcc-client-api-infra`)
   - Phase 6 creates pcc-client-api infrastructure before Phase 7 deploys the app
2. **Repository structure clarified**:
   - `core/pcc-tf-library`: All reusable terraform modules
   - `infra/pcc-app-shared-infra`: Calls modules for GKE, AlloyDB, cross-project IAM
   - `infra/pcc-{service}-api-infra`: Service-specific SA, Workload Identity, IAM
   - `core/pcc-app-argo-config`: GitOps manifests (namespaces, RBAC)
3. **ArgoCD creates namespaces via GitOps** (not kubectl, not terraform)
4. **Cloud Build does NOT need GKE access** - ArgoCD handles all deployments
5. **First service is pcc-client-api** (not pcc-auth-api)

## Next Steps
1. Create 7 individual Phase 3 subphase files following Phase 0-2 pattern
2. Delete temporary `phase-3-subphases.md` file
3. Begin Phase 3 implementation (deploy 3 GKE clusters)
