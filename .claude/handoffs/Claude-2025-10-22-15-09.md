# Session Handoff: Phase 4 ArgoCD Planning - Agent-Organizer Reviews (Continued)

## Project Context
- Continuing Phase 4 (ArgoCD dual-cluster deployment) planning for PortCo Connect devtest environment
- Creating comprehensive subphase documents via agent-organizer reviews for quality assurance
- Parallel workflow: Wife executing Phase 2 (AlloyDB), user planning Phase 4
- Total: 12 subphases (4.1A/B/C, 4.2A/B, 4.3-4.9)

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Phase 4.1B Security Review**: 8 issues identified (2 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM)
  - Applied corrections with user adjustments: sync permissions OK for developers (small team trust), 90-day audit retention (not 1 year)
  - Added: OAuth 2.0 PKCE/JWT validation, session security controls, Cloud Armor rules, credential rotation schedule
  - Updated working notes with all security fixes
- ✅ **Phase 4.1C Repository Review**: 8 issues identified (2 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM)
  - Critical: Missing GitHub SSH key generation procedure, Secret Manager integration pattern unclear
  - High: Prometheus availability decision needed, alert thresholds undefined, DR procedures incomplete
  - Medium: Redis redundancy with 4.2A, monitoring tool comparison, rotation schedule misalignment
  - **Status**: Awaiting user preferences before applying corrections

## Pending Tasks
- ⏳ **Phase 4.1C Corrections**: User asked for preferences on:
  - SSH key type: ECDSA P-256 vs RSA 4096 (agent recommended ECDSA)
  - Monitoring: GCP-native vs Prometheus/Grafana (agent recommended GCP-native)
  - Rotation: Align to 90-day (agent recommended)
  - DR testing: Quarterly vs monthly/annually (agent recommended quarterly)
- [ ] **Remaining Reviews**: Phases 4.3-4.9 (8 subphases)
- [ ] **Create Individual Phase Documents**: After all reviews complete

## Next Steps
1. Get user preferences on 4.1C corrections (SSH key type, monitoring tool, testing frequency)
2. Apply Phase 4.1C corrections to working notes
3. Continue agent-organizer reviews: Phase 4.3 (Install ArgoCD Nonprod)
4. Complete reviews for phases 4.4-4.9
5. Create individual phase markdown files after all reviews validated
6. OR switch to Phase 2 execution (PCC-99: Terraform validation) if user wants to pivot

## Key Architectural Decisions (Locked In)
- **ArgoCD version**: v3.1.9 (both clusters)
- **HA**: Nonprod single-replica, Prod multi-replica with Redis HA
- **Ingress**: GKE Ingress, Google-managed SSL, Cloud Armor DDoS protection
- **RBAC**: Developers get sync permissions (small team trust model), 90-day audit retention
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE, JWT validation, 15-min idle timeout, 90-day credential rotation
- **DNS**: Regional naming (argocd-nonprod-east4, argocd-east4)
