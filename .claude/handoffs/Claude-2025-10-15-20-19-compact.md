# Session Handoff: Apigee Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Project Context
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for Apigee CI/CD pipeline deploying 7 .NET microservices to GKE
- Used Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Zen MCP) for multi-phase planning with deep thinking
- Target: devtest environment initially, with expansion to dev/staging/prod
- Architecture: GitHub → Cloud Build (9 steps) → Docker/GCS/ArgoCD/Apigee
- Services: auth, client, user, metric-builder, metric-tracker, task-builder, task-tracker

## Completed Tasks
- Generated 8-phase implementation plan with Gemini planner agent (8 sequential steps)
- Documented complete plan at `.claude/plans/apigee-pipeline-implementation-plan.md`
- Plan includes:
  - Phase 1: Terraform infrastructure (pcc-tf-library, GCP resources, service accounts)
  - Phase 2: Pipeline library (5 bash scripts: build, generate-spec, update-config, wait-argocd, deploy-apigee)
  - Phase 3: ArgoCD config (K8s manifests for all 7 services)
  - Phase 4: POC with pcc-auth-api (Dockerfile, cloudbuild.yaml, validation)
  - Phase 5: Second service validation (pcc-client-api)
  - Phase 6: Parallel rollout (5 remaining services with automation)
  - Phase 7: Multi-environment prep (monitoring, runbook, disaster recovery)
  - Phase 8: Future enhancements (auto-scaling, cost optimization, security)
- Plan approved by user, ready for implementation
- All scripts, templates, and configurations documented with code examples

## Pending Tasks
- User needs to decide which phase to start implementing:
  - Option 1: Phase 1 (Terraform infrastructure setup)
  - Option 2: Phase 2 (Pipeline library scripts)
  - Option 3: Phase 3 (ArgoCD manifests)
  - Option 4: Phase 4 (POC with pcc-auth-api)
  - Option 5: Sequential from Phase 1
- Implementation has NOT started yet - plan is in documentation phase only

## Next Steps
1. User to select starting phase (awaiting input)
2. Once phase selected, begin implementation with:
   - Create necessary directory structures
   - Generate scripts/templates from plan
   - Test locally where possible
   - Document any deviations from plan
3. Track progress with TodoWrite tool for multi-step phases
4. Reference plan document: `.claude/plans/apigee-pipeline-implementation-plan.md`

## References
- **Plan Document**: `.claude/plans/apigee-pipeline-implementation-plan.md` (complete 8-phase plan)
- **Requirements**: `.claude/reference/apigee-pipeline-requirements.markdown` (source requirements)
- **Project Context**: `CLAUDE.md` (master instructions)
- **Repomix Output**: `@repomix-output.xml` (full codebase context)
- **Zen MCP**: Used Gemini 2.5 Pro model via `mcp__zen__planner` tool
- **Continuation ID**: `65989ace-8721-4df2-b03a-116e79d792e4` (for future Zen planning sessions)

## Key Architectural Decisions
- Centralized pipeline library (pcc-pipeline-library) with reusable scripts
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment (pcc-app-argo-config)
- Terraform for infrastructure (pcc-tf-library deployed via pcc-app-shared-infra)
- OpenAPI spec generation with jq filtering per service
- Service onboarding target: ≤15 minutes per service
- Backend URL pattern: `http://pcc-{service}-api.{env}.svc.cluster.local`
- Branch-to-environment mapping: devtest→devtest, dev→dev, staging→staging, main→prod

## Critical Notes
- .NET 10 is NOT compatible with Swashbuckle - dev team building OpenAPI specs separately
- OpenAPI specs will be either built at build time or checked into repo
- All services must have routes matching basepath: `/{service-name}/*`
- Secret Manager tokens required: git-token, argocd-password, apigee-access-token
- Workload Identity bindings critical for Cloud Build SA → ArgoCD
- POC (Phase 4) must succeed before parallel rollout (Phase 6)

## Metadata
- **Session Duration**: ~1.5 hours (planning phase)
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-15 20:19 EDT
- **Models Used**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (orchestration), Gemini 2.5 Pro (planning)
- **Plan Status**: Documented, approved, awaiting implementation start
- **Token Usage**: 128K/200K (plan mode, no code written yet)
