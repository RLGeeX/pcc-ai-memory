# Session Handoff: Phase 4 & Phase 7 Planning with Jira Integration Complete

## Project Context
- Created comprehensive implementation plans for Phase 4 (GKE DevOps Prod Cluster) and Phase 7 (ArgoCD Production Deployment)
- Both phases use modern micro-chunked planning approach (300-500 tokens, 2-3 tasks per chunk)
- Full Jira integration with sub-tasks created under existing parent stories

## Completed Tasks
- **Phase 4 Plan**: 12 micro-chunks created in `.claude/plans/phase-4-gke-devops-prod/`
  - Plan-meta.json with execution config (960 minutes estimated)
  - All 12 chunks with agent assignments and step-by-step instructions
  - Jira: 12 sub-tasks created (PCC-272 through PCC-280, PCC-305 through PCC-307) under parent PCC-121
  - All assigned to Christine Fogarty with DevOps label

- **Phase 7 Plan**: 24 micro-chunks created in `.claude/plans/phase-7-argocd-prod/`
  - Plan-meta.json with execution config (1440 minutes estimated)
  - All 24 chunks with agent assignments covering HA deployment, 14-day backups, resource quotas
  - Jira: 24 sub-tasks created (PCC-281 through PCC-304) under parent PCC-78
  - All assigned to Christine Fogarty with DevOps label

- **Production Configuration Decisions Captured**:
  - NetworkPolicies: Wide-open egress (egress: [{}]) - same as nonprod
  - RBAC: policy.default: role:readonly workaround stays - NO BL-003 required
  - Backups: 14-day retention (Phase 7)
  - HA: Multi-replica (controller=2, repo=2, server=2, Redis HA=3)
  - Resource Quotas: Required for production

## Pending Tasks
- None - both plans complete with 100% Jira coverage
- Ready for execution when user decides to proceed

## Next Steps
- **Execute Phase 4** (if needed): Use `/cc-unleashed:plan-next` or `/cc-unleashed:plan-execute`
  - Deploy production GKE cluster (pcc-gke-devops-prod)
  - Validate Connect Gateway and Workload Identity
  - Create cluster documentation

- **Execute Phase 7** (after Phase 4 complete): Use `/cc-unleashed:plan-next` or `/cc-unleashed:plan-execute`
  - Deploy ArgoCD 7.7.11 with HA to production cluster
  - Configure 14-day backups with Velero
  - Set up monitoring and DR procedures

- **Check Jira Status**: View progress in Jira under PCC-121 (Phase 4) and PCC-78 (Phase 7)

## References
- Phase 4 Plan: `.claude/plans/phase-4-gke-devops-prod/`
  - plan-meta.json, chunk-001 through chunk-012
  - Jira: PCC-272 to PCC-280, PCC-305 to PCC-307

- Phase 7 Plan: `.claude/plans/phase-7-argocd-prod/`
  - plan-meta.json, chunk-001 through chunk-024
  - Jira: PCC-281 to PCC-304

- Key Decisions:
  - Wide-open egress NetworkPolicy (both phases)
  - RBAC workaround without BL-003 (Phase 7)
  - 14-day backup retention (Phase 7)
  - Multi-replica HA configuration (Phase 7)
