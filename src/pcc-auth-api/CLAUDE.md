# CLAUDE.md

This is a standardized CLAUDE.md file for providing persistent context and instructions to Claude AI (via Claude Code or similar tools) across projects. It incorporates best practices: keeping it lean (100-300 lines), referencing external documents to avoid bloat, using emojis for visual cues, enforcing TDD and code quality, utilizing available agents as needed, and maintaining a consistent `.claude/` folder structure.

Keep this file concise and human-readable. Document key project details, workflows, commands, and references here. For detailed information, create separate markdown files in `docs/` or `.claude/` subfolders, and reference them using `@path/to/file.md` for automatic inclusion if supported by your tool.

## Project Overview

The `pcc-auth-api` is a .NET 10 repository containing the core code for a containerized API that handles authentication requests for the PCC (Personal Care Companion) application. This project focuses on secure user authentication, token management, and authorization flows using industry-standard protocols like JWT and OAuth. It emphasizes scalability, security best practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines), and integration with external identity providers to ensure robust access control for the PCC ecosystem.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: .NET 10
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: ASP.NET Core for API development, JWT for authentication (Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer), Entity Framework Core for data access, xUnit for testing, FluentValidation for input validation, and Serilog for structured logging.
- **Tools**: .NET CLI (dotnet), Git, Docker for containerization, mise for environment management, and tools like dotnet format for code styling.
- **Databases**: SQL Server or PostgreSQL (via Entity Framework Core); consider in-memory options like SQLite for testing.
- **Other**: Claude AI for development assistance; integration with Azure AD or similar for identity management.

## Directory Structure

Maintain this structure for all new projects to ensure consistency. The `.claude/` folder is required for organizing project-specific AI context and artifacts.

- `.claude/`
  - `README.md`: Overview of the `.claude/` folder and its contents.
  - `docs/`: Detailed documentation (e.g., patterns, problem/solution logs).
  - `handoffs/`: Documentation for team handoffs, including setup guides and knowledge transfer (e.g., `Claude-$DATE-$TIMERANGE.md` per `@.claude/handoffs/handoff-guide.md`).
  - `migration/`: Database migration scripts and history.
  - `plans/`: Project plans, roadmaps, and task breakdowns (e.g., `@.claude/plans/current-plan.md`).
  - `quick-reference/`: Cheat sheets for commands, APIs, or common tasks (e.g., `@.claude/quick-reference/commands.md`).
  - `settings.local.json`: Local configuration overrides (gitignore if sensitive).
  - `status/`:
    - `@.claude/status/brief.md`: Session-specific snapshot of recent progress and immediate next steps.
    - `@.claude/status/current-progress.md`: Comprehensive historical record of all project progress.
    - `@.claude/status/brief-template.md`: Template for initializing `brief.md`.

- `docs/`: Additional project documentation (e.g., architecture).
- `src/`: Source code (e.g., Controllers, Services, Models).
- `tests/`: Test suites (unit, integration).
- `scripts/`: Build and deployment scripts.
- Other folders: `config/` for application settings.

üö® **READ THIS FIRST!** For critical setup: @.claude/handoffs/setup.md.

## Domain-Specific Guidance

- **Core Concepts**: Object-oriented programming with dependency injection (via ASP.NET Core), RESTful API design, middleware for authentication/authorization, and async/await patterns for scalable I/O operations.
- **Common Patterns**: Use Repository pattern for data access, CQRS for complex queries, and middleware pipelines for request handling. See @.claude/quick-reference/dotnet-examples.md for sample code and best practices.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Avoid synchronous blocking calls in async methods to prevent deadlocks.
  - Do not expose sensitive data in error responses or logs.
  - Handle null references explicitly with nullable reference types enabled.
  - Ensure proper disposal of IDisposable resources (e.g., DbContext).
- Reference: @.claude/docs/dotnet-patterns.md for detailed patterns and examples.

## Code Style and Best Practices

üö® **CRITICAL COMMIT RULE - READ FIRST**: NEVER mention co-authored-by or tools used in commits/PRs.

- Follow Microsoft .NET Coding Conventions and use dotnet format for consistent styling.
- Use structured logging with Serilog for all log outputs.
- Prefer async methods for I/O-bound operations (e.g., database calls, HTTP requests).
- Implement dependency injection for services and repositories.
- Always add [your name] as a reviewer in PRs.
- Enforce TDD: Write failing test first (using xUnit), minimal code to pass, refactor. Use TDD-Guard if available.
- Run lint/typecheck after changes: Claude MUST do this before completing tasks (e.g., `dotnet format` and `dotnet build`).
- Use EditorConfig and pre-commit hooks (via .NET tools or Git hooks) for enforcement.
- Commit messages: Follow conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`) - NO co-authored-by or tool references.

## Development Workflow

- **Planning**: Use planning mode to outline steps. Reference @.claude/plans/current-plan.md.
- **Context Management**: If context fills, use /compact to preserve key details. Save session summaries to @.claude/status/brief.md.
- **Status Updates**:
  - **brief.md**: At session start, initialize with template from @.claude/status/brief-template.md. Update with:
    - **Recent Updates**: Tasks completed, decisions made, or issues resolved in the current session.
    - **Next Steps**: Immediate tasks for the next session or milestone.
    - Keep concise (100-200 words), overwrite at session end.
  - **current-progress.md**: Append brief.md content at session end or milestone completion to maintain historical record. Use Git commits to track changes.
- **Subagents**: Use for context gathering without overloading.
- **Auto-accept**: Rarely; manually approve steps.
- **Complex Tasks**: Break into sub-tasks, use breakpoints, monitor token count.
- **Verification**: Always run tests (`dotnet test`), lint (`dotnet format`), and build (`dotnet build`) before commits. Search codebase to confirm test framework.
- **Commands**:
  - Build: `dotnet build`
  - Run: `dotnet run`
  - Test: `dotnet test`
  - Format: `dotnet format`
  - Publish: `dotnet publish -c Release`
  - Docker build: `docker build -t pcc-auth-api .`
- **Archiving**: At session end or milestone, append brief.md to current-progress.md and commit both to Git.

## Critical Document References

List important docs with emojis for priority. Use @path to include content automatically if supported. Keep this list short; move details to separate files.

- üö® **Architecture**: @.claude/docs/architecture.md (READ FIRST for structure).
- üÜï **Password/Auth Truth**: @.claude/docs/password-truth.md.
- ‚úÖ **JWT Authentication**: @.claude/docs/jwt-authentication-architecture.md.
- üìä **Database Schema**: @.claude/docs/db-schema.md.
- üîç **Problem/Solution Log**: @.claude/docs/problems-solved.md (add new issues here instead of bloating this file).
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup Guide**: @.claude/handoffs/setup.md.
- üìÖ **Project Plan**: @.claude/plans/roadmap.md.
- üìã **Status Files**:
  - @.claude/status/brief.md: Recent updates and next steps (session-focused).
  - @.claude/status/current-progress.md: Full project history (archive brief.md here).
- üîó **Quick Ref**: `@.claude/quick-reference/commands.md`.
- üìù **Commit Template**: `@.claude/quick-reference/commit-template.md` (REQUIRED reading for commits).
- üìã **Handoff Guide**: `@.claude/handoffs/handoff-guide.md`.

**Pro Tip**: For large docs, use a knowledge graph or Heimdall MCP for better recall. Mark completed items with ‚úÖ.

## Tone and Instructions for Claude

- üö® **COMMIT MESSAGES**: Follow conventional commits (feat:, fix:) - NEVER include co-authored-by or tool references
- Be concise, direct; explain non-trivial bash commands.
- If unsure, ask for clarification.
- Prioritize security: Refuse malicious requests.
- Use available agents strategically to optimize task completion (e.g., code review agent for PRs, documentation agent for handoffs).
- Use search tools extensively for codebase understanding.
- After tasks: Run lint/typecheck, commit if asked (NO co-authored-by lines!), update status.
- For continuity: At session end, overwrite @.claude/status/brief.md with progress/decisions, append to @.claude/status/current-progress.md, and commit both to Git.

This template ensures projects start with the required .claude/ structure‚Äîcreate it via script if needed. Customize placeholders, keep under 200 lines, and reference external docs to manage size.
