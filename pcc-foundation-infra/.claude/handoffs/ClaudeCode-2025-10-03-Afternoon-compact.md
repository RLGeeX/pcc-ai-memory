# PCC Foundation Infrastructure - Handoff Document

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Time:** 3:10 PM EDT (Afternoon)
**Tool:** Claude Code
**Session Type:** Planning - VPC/Subnet Remediation Analysis
**Previous Handoff:** ClaudeCode-2025-10-02-Afternoon-Part3.md

## 1. Project Overview

**Project:** PCC GCP Foundation Infrastructure
**Repository:** pcc-foundation-infra
**Current Phase:** ✅ Foundation Deployed (217 resources) - Planning VPC/Subnet Corrections

**Objective:** Correct deployed subnet configuration to match authoritative IP allocation plan from subnet planning spreadsheet (PDF document). Foundation infrastructure is operational but subnets were deployed with incorrect CIDR ranges.

---

## 2. Current State

### ✅ Infrastructure Deployed (2025-10-02)
- **Total Resources:** 217 (all operational)
- **Security Score:** 9/10 (monitoring alerts pending)
- **Compliance:** CIS GCP Benchmark compliant
- Organization policies, folders, projects, IAM, logging - all correct

### ❌ Issue Identified (2025-10-03)
**Incorrect Subnets Deployed:**
- `pcc-subnet-prod-use4`: 10.16.0.0/20 (WRONG - should be GKE-specific)
- `pcc-subnet-prod-usc1`: 10.32.0.0/20 (WRONG - should be reserved)
- `pcc-subnet-nonprod-use4`: 10.24.0.0/20 (WRONG - should be GKE-specific)
- `pcc-subnet-nonprod-usc1`: 10.40.0.0/20 (WRONG - should be reserved)

**Root Cause:** During deployment, subnets were created with generic /20 ranges at beginning of address space instead of GKE-optimized ranges with secondary IPs per subnet planning document.

### ✅ Planning Complete (2025-10-03)
**Three specialized subagents analyzed the issue:**
1. **Cloud Architect:** Analyzed subnet planning PDF, confirmed correct IP scheme
2. **Backend Architect:** Created Terraform remediation strategy (45-50 min execution)
3. **Security Auditor:** Assessed security impact, identified firewall overpermissiveness

---

## 3. Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Subnet Remediation Required ✅
**Rationale:** User confirmed subnet planning spreadsheet is authoritative source and must be matched for planning purposes.

**Impact:**
- Destroy 4 incorrect subnets
- Create 2 GKE-optimized subnets with secondary ranges
- Reserve us-central1 (not deploy)

### Decision 2: Correct IP Scheme Identified ✅
**Per subnet planning PDF (.claude/reference/GCP Network Subnets - GKE Subnet Assignment Redesign.pdf):**

**us-east4 (deploy now):**
- **Production GKE:** `10.16.128.0/20` with secondary ranges:
  - Pods: `10.16.144.0/20`
  - Services: `10.16.160.0/20`
  - Overflow: `10.16.176.0/20` (reserved, not deployed)

- **NonProd GKE:** `10.24.128.0/20` with secondary ranges:
  - Pods: `10.24.144.0/20`
  - Services: `10.24.160.0/20`
  - Overflow: `10.24.176.0/20` (reserved, not deployed)

**us-central1 (reserve, do not deploy):**
- Production: `10.32.0.0/13` entire block reserved
- NonProd: `10.40.0.0/13` entire block reserved

### Decision 3: Deployment Approach ✅
- **No workloads deployed:** Safe to destroy/recreate (verified)
- **Firewall rules:** Reference VPC, will auto-update
- **Estimated time:** 45-50 minutes total
- **Risk level:** LOW (no workloads, clean slate)

---

## 4. Pending Tasks

### 🔴 High Priority - Subnet Remediation Execution

**Step 1: Destroy Current Subnets**
```bash
cd /home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh destroy \
  -target=google_compute_subnetwork.prod_use4 \
  -target=google_compute_subnetwork.prod_usc1 \
  -target=google_compute_subnetwork.nonprod_use4 \
  -target=google_compute_subnetwork.nonprod_usc1
```

**Step 2: Update Terraform Code**
File: `/home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform/modules/network/subnets.tf`

Replace all 4 subnet resources with 2 GKE-optimized subnets:
- `google_compute_subnetwork.prod_gke_use4` (10.16.128.0/20 + secondary ranges)
- `google_compute_subnetwork.nonprod_gke_use4` (10.24.128.0/20 + secondary ranges)

**Step 3: Apply Changes**
```bash
terraform plan  # Verify 4 destroys + 2 creates
terraform apply
```

**Step 4: Validate**
- Verify CIDR ranges: `gcloud compute networks subnets describe pcc-prj-devops-prod --region=us-east4`
- Check secondary ranges are configured
- Confirm firewall rules auto-updated
- Test Cloud NAT functionality

**Step 5: Commit Changes**
```bash
git add terraform/modules/network/subnets.tf
git commit -m "fix: align subnets with GKE-focused IP allocation plan

- Deploy GKE-optimized subnets in us-east4 only
- Primary: 10.16.128.0/20 (prod), 10.24.128.0/20 (nonprod)
- Secondary ranges for pods and services configured
- Reserve us-central1 for future DR expansion"
git push origin main
```

### 🟡 Medium Priority - Firewall Rules Update

**Issue:** Current firewall rules use overly permissive /13 CIDR blocks
- Prod: Allows `10.16.0.0/13` but subnet is only `10.16.128.0/20`
- Security gap: 128x more IPs allowed than allocated

**Fix:** Update firewall rules to reference subnet objects dynamically
File: `/home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform/modules/network/firewall.tf`

```hcl
# Change from:
source_ranges = ["10.16.0.0/13", "10.32.0.0/13"]

# To:
source_ranges = [
  google_compute_subnetwork.prod_gke_use4.ip_cidr_range,
]
```

### 🟢 Low Priority - Documentation Updates

- Update `.claude/status/brief.md` with corrected subnet configuration
- Update architecture documentation with GKE-focused design
- Document overflow ranges as reserved for future expansion

---

## 5. Blockers or Challenges

### ⚠️ No Active Blockers
- User confirmed subnet planning PDF is authoritative
- No workloads deployed (verified)
- Terraform remediation plan ready
- All required information gathered

### ⚠️ Potential Risks (Mitigated)
1. **Cloud NAT disruption:** 30-120 seconds during subnet recreation (acceptable)
2. **VPC Flow Log gap:** 2-5 minutes during recreation (documented)
3. **Firewall rule gap:** Rules auto-update but brief inconsistency possible

**Mitigation:** Execute during low-activity window, monitor logs

---

## 6. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **Review Terraform code changes** with user before executing
2. **Backup Terraform state:** `terraform state pull > backup.json`
3. **Execute subnet remediation** (Step 1-5 above)
4. **Validate deployment** against PDF document
5. **Update firewall rules** to fix overpermissiveness

### Post-Remediation

1. Update documentation to reflect GKE-focused architecture
2. Mark us-central1 as reserved in architecture diagrams
3. Document overflow ranges for future expansion
4. Update network validation scripts with new CIDR ranges

## 9. Additional Notes

### What Went Right
- ✅ User confirmed authoritative source (subnet planning PDF)
- ✅ Three-agent analysis provided comprehensive understanding
- ✅ No workloads deployed - optimal timing for fix
- ✅ Clear remediation plan with step-by-step instructions
- ✅ All stakeholders understand GKE-focused architecture

### What Was Clarified
- **Secondary ranges are NOT separate subnets** - they're additional IP ranges on the same physical subnet
- **Overflow ranges are reserved** - not deployed as secondary ranges initially
- **us-central1 is completely reserved** - no deployment in Phase 1
- **Total physical subnets:** 2 (not 6) - confusion about counting secondary ranges resolved

### Critical Reminders
1. **Subnet planning PDF is authoritative** - must match exactly
2. **Secondary ranges attach to primary subnet** - not standalone resources
3. **us-central1 reserved for DR** - do not deploy until Phase 2
4. **Firewall rules need update** - currently overpermissive (separate task)
5. **Overflow ranges reserved** - for future GKE expansion if needed

---

**Status:** ✅ Planning Complete - Ready for Execution
**Next Session:** Execute subnet remediation (45-50 minutes)
**Risk Level:** LOW (no workloads, comprehensive plan, user approval)
**Documentation:** All analysis reports available for reference
