## Completed Work

### Session: 2025-10-02 Morning (Continued) - Part 2

#### ‚úÖ Terraform Initialization & Planning Complete
- [x] Created impersonation wrapper script (terraform-with-impersonation.sh)
  - Generates access token via gcloud impersonation
  - Sets GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable
  - No application-default credentials required
  - Works with "pcc" gcloud configuration
- [x] Removed impersonate_service_account from backend.tf
  - Backend uses token directly from environment variable
  - Prevents double-impersonation error
- [x] Successfully initialized Terraform with GCS backend
  - Backend: gs://pcc-tfstate-foundation-us-east4/pcc-foundation-infra
  - All modules loaded successfully
  - Provider plugins installed
- [x] Generated terraform plan successfully
  - **Plan: 200 resources to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy**
  - Plan saved to: terraform/tfplan
  - All 6 modules validated
- [x] Resolved authentication issues
  - Issue: Backend impersonation requires base credentials
  - Solution: Use GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN from gcloud impersonation
  - Documentation research via context7 MCP confirmed approach

**Key Technical Decision:**
- Service account impersonation via environment variable instead of ADC
- User manages multiple GCP accounts via gcloud configurations
- Wrapper script provides clean separation between accounts

#### ‚úÖ Code Validation Complete (Part 1)
- [x] Fixed terraform validation error in log-export module
  - Removed invalid `unique_writer_identity` argument from `google_logging_organization_sink`
  - Resource automatically creates unique writer identity
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` security
  - Added `*.tfplan` and `*.tfplan.*` patterns
  - Verified terraform.tfvars is properly excluded
- [x] Terraform validation passed
  - `terraform init -backend=false` successful
  - `terraform validate` successful
  - All 52 files validated

#### ‚úÖ Code Generation Complete (2025-10-02 Morning)
- [x] Generated 52 files via 3 specialized subagents
  - cloud-architect: 43 Terraform files (1,997 lines)
  - backend-developer: 3 helper scripts (executable)
  - documentation-expert: 6 documentation files
- [x] Terraform modules created (6 total):
  - folders/ - 7-folder hierarchy
  - projects/ - 14 projects with Shared VPC
  - network/ - 2 VPCs, 6 subnets, GKE ranges, routers, NAT, firewall
  - iam/ - 5 Google Workspace groups IAM bindings
  - org-policies/ - 19 organization policies (updated from 16)
  - log-export/ - Organization log sink to BigQuery
- [x] Helper scripts created:
  - create-state-bucket.sh (4.4 KB)
  - validate-prereqs.sh (6.2 KB)
  - setup-google-workspace-groups.sh (6.5 KB)
- [x] Documentation created:

  - terraform/.terraform-version (1.5.0)
  - terraform/.tflint.hcl
  - terraform.tfvars.example
  - terraform.tfvars (actual values, git-ignored)

    - compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes
    - compute.trustedImageProjects
    - compute.disableNestedVirtualization
  - Created terraform.tfvars with actual deployment values
- [x] All code formatted with `terraform fmt`

### Session: 2025-10-01 Afternoon

#### ‚úÖ Planning Phase (Complete)
- [x] Read all reference materials (CLAUDE.md, PDF, network-layout.md, project-layout.md)
- [x] Analyzed Google-generated Terraform files in `.claude/reference/tf/`
- [x] Launched 3 parallel subagents for comprehensive analysis:
  - cloud-architect: Infrastructure design, network architecture, cost estimation
  - security-auditor: IAM design, org policies, Google Workspace groups
  - backend-architect: Terraform module structure, state management, deployment strategy
- [x] Created comprehensive foundation setup plan
- [x] Incorporated user feedback (3 rounds of revisions)
- [x] **Final plan approved by user**

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. No partner folders initially (defer for future expansion)
2. GKE subnets ONLY for devops projects (not app/data/systems)
3. Two-bucket state strategy:
   - `pcc-tfstate-foundation-us-east4` (in pcc-prj-bootstrap, foundation only)
   - `pcc-tfstate-us-east4` (in pcc-prj-devops-prod, future applications)
4. No customer-managed encryption keys (use Google-managed)
5. Clean project names without random IDs: `pcc-prj-<category>-<environment>`
6. Use existing service account: `pcc-sa-terraform@pcc-prj-bootstrap.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
7. 5-week phased deployment (defer Week 6 testing to post-foundation)
8. ~~31~~ **5 Google Workspace groups** for IAM access control (simplified 2025-10-01 for 6-person team)
9. 20 organization policies for security guardrails

## Blockers & Challenges

### üö® Active Blockers

1. **Code Generation Deferred**
   - **Impact:** Cannot proceed to deployment phase
   - **Status:** Awaiting user approval
   - **User Quote:** "i approve the plan but I don't want to start code creation yet"
   - **Next Action:** Wait for user to request code generation

2. ~~**Google Workspace Groups Not Created**~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (2025-10-01)**
   - **Was Impact:** Blocks Week 5 (IAM binding phase)
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All 5 groups created and members assigned
   - **Completed:** 2025-10-01
   - **Groups Created:**
     - gcp-admins@pcconnect.ai (jfogarty, cfogarty)
     - gcp-developers@pcconnect.ai (slanning)
     - gcp-break-glass@pcconnect.ai (jfogarty, cfogarty)
     - gcp-auditors@pcconnect.ai (jfogarty)
     - gcp-cicd@pcconnect.ai (empty - for Workload Identity)
   - **Next Action:** Week 5 IAM binding phase is now unblocked

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks

1. ~~**Service Account Permissions**~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (2025-10-01)**
   - **Was Risk:** Service account may lack required organization-level permissions
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Has roles/owner (full access)
   - **Validated By:** cfogarty@pcconnect.ai (2025-10-01 16:13 EDT)

2. **Organization Policy Impact**
   - **Risk:** Org policies may conflict with existing workloads (if any)
   - **Mitigation:** Foundation is fresh setup, no existing workloads expected

3. **Cost Overruns**
   - **Risk:** Baseline costs are $360-570/month; actual costs depend on workload usage
   - **Mitigation:** Enable billing alerts, review costs weekly during deployment

### Session: 2025-10-03 Afternoon - SUBNET REMEDIATION EXECUTION

#### üîÑ Issue Discovery & Planning
- [x] Identified incorrect subnet CIDR ranges deployed on 2025-10-02
  - Current: 10.16.0.0/20 (prod), 10.24.0.0/20 (nonprod), 10.32.0.0/20 (prod-usc1), 10.40.0.0/20 (nonprod-usc1)
  - Required: 10.16.128.0/20 (prod GKE), 10.24.128.0/20 (nonprod GKE) per subnet planning PDF
  - Root cause: Autonomous CIDR change during deployment without consulting authoritative document
- [x] Launched 3 subagent analyses (cloud-architect, backend-architect, security-auditor)
  - Cloud-architect: Confirmed GKE-focused IP allocation from PDF
  - Backend-architect: Created comprehensive remediation plan (45-50 min execution)
  - Security-auditor: Identified firewall overpermissiveness (128x - separate task)
- [x] Clarified GKE secondary range architecture
  - 2 physical subnets (not 6) with secondary IP ranges attached
  - Secondary ranges: pods (10.16.144.0/20), services (10.16.160.0/20)
  - Overflow ranges: reserved for future expansion, not deployed initially
  - us-central1: Entire /13 blocks reserved for DR (10.32.0.0/13 prod, 10.40.0.0/13 nonprod)
- [x] User approval received for subnet remediation
  - Confirmed no workloads deployed (safe to destroy/recreate)
  - Confirmed subnet planning PDF is authoritative source
  - Risk level: LOW

#### üîÑ Remediation Execution (In Progress)
- [ ] **Step 1: Destroy Incorrect Subnets** (backend-architect)
  - Target: 4 subnets (prod-use4, prod-usc1, nonprod-use4, nonprod-usc1)
  - Command: terraform destroy with -target flags
  - Estimated time: 10-15 minutes
  - Status: Launching subagent
- [ ] **Step 2: Update Terraform Code** (backend-architect)
  - File: terraform/modules/network/subnets.tf
  - Replace 4 generic subnets with 2 GKE-optimized subnets
  - Add secondary_ip_range blocks for pods and services
  - Document overflow ranges as reserved (comments)
  - Status: Pending Step 1 completion
- [ ] **Step 3: Apply Corrected Configuration** (deployment-engineer)
  - Command: terraform plan + apply
  - Expected: 4 destroys + 2 creates
  - Estimated time: 15-20 minutes
  - Status: Pending Step 2 completion
- [ ] **Step 4: Validate Deployment** (cloud-architect)
  - Verify CIDR ranges match PDF exactly
  - Check secondary ranges configured
  - Confirm firewall rules auto-updated
  - Test Cloud NAT functionality
  - Status: Pending Step 3 completion
- [ ] **Step 5: Fix Firewall Rules** (separate task)
  - Update firewall.tf to reference subnet objects dynamically
  - Remove hardcoded /13 CIDR blocks
  - Status: Deferred to post-remediation

#### Key Decisions (2025-10-03)
1. **Subnet Planning PDF is Authoritative Source**
   - File: .claude/reference/GCP Network Subnets - GKE Subnet Assignment Redesign.pdf
   - Must match exactly for planning purposes
   - All future subnet changes require PDF consultation

2. **GKE-Focused Architecture Confirmed**
   - Only devops projects get GKE subnets initially
   - us-east4 deployed, us-central1 reserved for DR
   - 2 physical subnets with secondary ranges (not 6 separate subnets)

3. **Orchestration Strategy**
   - Use specialized subagents for each phase
   - Run independent tasks in parallel when possible
   - Track progress in TodoWrite tool
