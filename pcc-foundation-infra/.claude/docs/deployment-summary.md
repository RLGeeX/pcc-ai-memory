| iam | Org IAM Bindings | 7 | LOW |
| iam | Project IAM Bindings | 59 | MEDIUM |
| network | Subnets (use4) | 2 | LOW |
| log_export | Dataset Update | 1 | LOW |

  - Network: pcc-prj-network-nonprod, pcc-prj-network-prod
  - App: pcc-prj-app-{dev,devtest,staging,prod}
  - Data: pcc-prj-data-{dev,devtest,staging,prod}

- Flow Logs: Enabled (10min interval, 0.5 sampling, all metadata)
- Secondary ranges: GKE pods/services (if configured)

---

## Phased Deployment Plan

### Recommended Approach: 4 Stages (20-32 minutes)

```
Stage 1: Org IAM (7)          →  2-3 min   LOW risk
   ↓
Stage 2: Network (3)          →  3-5 min   LOW risk
   ↓
Stage 3: Project IAM (59)     →  5-7 min   MEDIUM risk
   ↓
Stage 4: Final Validation     →  5-10 min  N/A
```

### Alternative Approach: Single Stage (10-15 minutes)
Deploy all 69 resources at once using the pre-generated plan file.

**Recommendation:** Use phased approach for production deployments to minimize risk and enable quick rollback.

## Resource Count by Environment

| Environment | Projects | Subnets | Service Projects | IAM Bindings |
|------------|----------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Production | 7 | 3 | 6 | ~30 |
| Non-Production | 7 | 3 | 6 | ~30 |
| Shared | 1 (logging) | 0 | 0 | ~5 |
| **Total** | **15** | **6** | **12** | **66** |

## Deployment Commands Quick Reference

### Stage 1: Organization IAM
```bash
cd /home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh apply \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.admins_org_admin \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.admins_billing_admin \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.admins_security_admin \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.admins_xpn_admin \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.auditors_security_reviewer \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.auditors_logging_viewer \
  -target=module.iam.google_organization_iam_member.break_glass_org_admin
```

### Stage 2: Network Completion
```bash
cd /home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh apply \
  -target=module.network.google_compute_subnetwork.nonprod_use4 \
  -target=module.network.google_compute_subnetwork.prod_use4 \
  -target=module.log_export.google_bigquery_dataset.org_logs
```

### Stage 3: Project IAM
```bash
cd /home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh apply \
  -target=module.iam.google_project_iam_member.admins_owner
```

### Stage 4: Full Deployment (All Remaining)
```bash
cd /home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh apply tfplan-full
```

### Alternative: Single-Stage Full Deployment
```bash
cd /home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra/terraform
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh apply tfplan-full
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Resources (12)
- 7 organization IAM bindings (additive, easily reversible)
- 2 network subnets (additive, no dependencies)
- 1 BigQuery dataset retention update (metadata only)
- 2 log export updates

**Mitigation:** Standard rollback via `terraform destroy -target`

### Medium Risk Resources (59)
- 59 project IAM bindings (grants owner permissions)

**Mitigation:**
- Deploy in stages (network → app → data → devops → systems)
- Validate after each batch
- Use pre-generated plan file to avoid surprises

### High Risk Resources
- None in this deployment

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Total state count: 208 resources
- [ ] `terraform plan` exit code: 0 (no changes)
- [ ] All IAM bindings visible in GCP Console
- [ ] All 6 subnets operational
- [ ] Organization sink collecting logs

### Security Validation
- [ ] Organization policies: 17 enforced
- [ ] Admin group has org admin role
- [ ] Auditor group has read-only access
- [ ] Break-glass group configured
- [ ] No public IP access (except where needed)

### Network Validation
- [ ] 2 VPCs (prod/nonprod) operational
- [ ] 6 subnets (2 regions + devops) configured
- [ ] 12 service projects attached to Shared VPC
- [ ] Cloud NAT operational in both regions
- [ ] Firewall rules applied correctly

## Estimated Costs

### Current Infrastructure (139 resources)
- **Organization policies:** Free
- **Folders/Projects:** Free
- **VPCs/Subnets:** Free (except egress)
- **Cloud Routers:** ~$43/month per router × 4 = ~$172/month
- **Cloud NAT:** ~$45/month per NAT × 4 = ~$180/month
- **BigQuery (logging):** ~$20/month (estimated, depends on volume)

**Total Current Monthly Cost:** ~$372/month

### Post-Deployment (208 resources)
- **IAM bindings:** Free
- **Additional subnets:** Free (except egress)

**Total Post-Deployment Monthly Cost:** ~$372/month (no change from IAM/subnet additions)

**Note:** Actual costs will increase when workloads are deployed (GKE, VMs, storage, etc.)
