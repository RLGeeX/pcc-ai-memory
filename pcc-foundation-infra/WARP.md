# WARP.md - Session Continuity Guide

**Repository:** pcc-foundation-infra  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02 18:57:21Z  
**Current Phase:** Core Infrastructure DEPLOYED - Network & Security Active

---

## Quick Context for New Sessions

### üéØ Project Mission
Deploy GCP foundation infrastructure using Terraform for PCC (pcconnect.ai). This provides the base platform (folders, projects, networks, IAM, security policies) that all future applications will build upon.

### üìä Current Status: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYED ‚úÖ

**What's Done:**
- ‚úÖ **Planning Phase (100%)** - Comprehensive foundation setup plan created and approved
- ‚úÖ **Documentation (100%)** - All key documents created and saved
- ‚úÖ **Service Account Permissions (100%)** - Billing admin role added, all permissions verified
- ‚úÖ **Code Generation (100%)** - Complete Terraform infrastructure codebase created
- ‚úÖ **Foundation Deployment (85%)** - Core infrastructure LIVE and operational
  - ‚úÖ **17 Organization Policies** deployed and enforcing security
  - ‚úÖ **7 Folder Structure** deployed with complete hierarchy
  - ‚úÖ **15 Projects** deployed with APIs enabled and shared VPC configured
  - ‚úÖ **2 VPCs** deployed with subnets, routers, NAT, and firewall rules
  - ‚úÖ **Comprehensive IAM Bindings** deployed across organization and projects

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Documents to Read First

**ALWAYS read these files at session start:**

1. **`.claude/status/current-progress.md`** - Complete project history and current status
2. **`.claude/plans/foundation-setup.md`** - 87KB approved deployment plan with all architecture decisions
3. **`.claude/reference/google-workspace-groups.md`** - All 31 required Google Workspace groups
4. **`.claude/handoffs/ClaudeCode-2025-10-01-Afternoon.md`** - Previous session handoff
5. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Repository guidance and workflows

**Reference Documents:**

- `.claude/reference/network-layout.md` - VPC architecture
- `.claude/reference/GCP Network Subnets - GKE Subnet Assignment Redesign.pdf` - GKE specs

---

## ‚ö° Critical Architecture Decisions (Approved)

1. **NO partner folders** initially (reserved for future expansion)
2. **GKE subnets ONLY** for DevOps projects (prod/nonprod), NOT app/data/systems
3. **Two-bucket state strategy**:
   - `pcc-tfstate-foundation-us-east4` (in pcc-prj-bootstrap, foundation only)
   - `pcc-tfstate-us-east4` (in pcc-prj-devops-prod, future applications)
4. **Clean project names** without random IDs: `pcc-prj-<category>-<environment>`
5. **Google-managed encryption** (NO customer-managed keys)
6. **Service account impersonation**: `pcc-sa-terraform@pcc-prj-bootstrap.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
7. **5-week phased deployment** (defer Week 6 testing to post-foundation)
8. **31 Google Workspace groups** for IAM access control
9. **17 organization policies** for security guardrails (DEPLOYED)

## üîß Common Commands & Operations

**IMPORTANT: Use Terraform Impersonation Script**

When running Terraform commands, **ALWAYS** use the impersonation script to ensure proper service account authentication:

```bash
# Use this script for all Terraform operations
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh <terraform-command>

# Examples:
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh init
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh plan
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh apply
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh state list
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh plan -target=module.network
```

**Script Details:**
- **Service Account:** pcc-sa-terraform@pcc-prj-bootstrap.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Access Token Lifetime:** 3600s (1 hour)
- **Script Location:** `../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh`
- **Usage:** Automatically generates access token and runs Terraform with proper authentication

**Manual Service Account Impersonation (if needed):**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account=pcc-sa-terraform@pcc-prj-bootstrap.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Direct Terraform Operations (use script instead):**
```bash
# DON'T USE THESE - Use the script above instead
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform plan -target=module.org_policies  # Target specific modules
```

**Infrastructure Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Check Terraform state (use impersonation script)
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh state list
../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh show module.network.google_compute_network.nonprod

# Check organization policies
gcloud org-policies list --organization=146990108557

# List deployed folders
gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=146990108557

# List all projects
gcloud projects list --filter="parent.type=folder"

# Check VPC networks
gcloud compute networks list

# Check subnets
gcloud compute networks subnets list

# Check firewall rules
gcloud compute firewall-rules list

# Check IAM bindings
gcloud organizations get-iam-policy 146990108557
gcloud projects get-iam-policy pcc-prj-logging-monitoring

# Check logging sinks
gcloud logging sinks list --organization=146990108557
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Quick Reference

**Permission Errors:**
- Verify service account impersonation configured
- Check org-level roles on pcc-sa-terraform@pcc-prj-bootstrap.iam.gserviceaccount.com

**State Bucket Issues:**
- Verify service account has roles/storage.objectAdmin on state bucket
- Check bucket exists: `gsutil ls -p pcc-prj-bootstrap | grep pcc-tfstate-foundation`

**Google Workspace Group Errors:**
- Ensure groups are marked as "Security" groups
- Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation after creation
- Verify with: `gcloud identity groups list --organization=pcconnect.ai`

**Network IP Conflicts:**
- Review subnet CIDRs in foundation-setup.md
- Production: 10.16.x.x, 10.32.x.x | Non-Prod: 10.24.x.x, 10.40.x.x

## üí° Session Startup Checklist

**When starting a new Warp session:**

1. ‚úÖ **Read current-progress.md** - Get latest status
2. ‚úÖ **Check for user request** - Code generation? Deployment? Questions?
3. ‚úÖ **Verify environment** - Still in `/home/cfogarty/git/pcc-foundation-infra`?
4. ‚úÖ **Review blockers** - Any changes to Google Workspace groups or service account permissions?
5. ‚úÖ **Check context** - Any new requirements or architecture changes?

**If user wants to deploy advanced features:**
- Use the Terraform impersonation script for all operations
- Focus on remaining epic user stories (PCC-21, PCC-22, PCC-23, PCC-31, PCC-32, PCC-36, PCC-38, PCC-39)
- Update Jira issue status as work is completed
- Update current-progress.md when milestones are reached

**If user asks about status:**
- Reference current-progress.md for detailed status
- Highlight that core infrastructure (85%) is deployed and operational
- Mention remaining advanced features in network, security, and monitoring

**If user asks questions:**
- Reference foundation-setup.md for detailed architecture
- Use Terraform state list to show what's actually deployed
- Check Jira epic progress for current work status
- Always use ../scripts/terraform-with-impersonation.sh for Terraform commands
